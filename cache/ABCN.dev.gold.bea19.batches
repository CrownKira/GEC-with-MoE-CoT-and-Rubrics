transport system and it will keep on in the future .\nBecause public transport is a cost effective and better resource allocation in mass transport system .\nAlso people need not to suffer high operating cost running their own car .\nBut it can use a cheaper way going to their destination especially it is far away from home .\nFor example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane travelling to another country .\nInstead it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on public plane .\nIn my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that does n't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used , so public transport continue to have future but people are going to use more the cars then bus or underground .\nIf we think about it the car is better because we do n't need to wait for them has we are waiting for the bus or underground but in another way car cust more money than the public transport .\nBy car we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n't need to be around people that are unkwoned but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so both trasnportations are good and the cars do n't need necessarialy to end up with the public transport .\nIf I had it to choose between both transportation I think I probably chose car because it is better for me to go by car then to go by bus .\nIn my community , we are very interested at environment and ecological things .\nWe have solar panels and a place to make compost at the last garden , with worms who eat and degrade all the organic waste of the school .\nIn some strategic points of the building we have

contamination , etc .\nThe manager of all this project is Miss June Sid , our science teacher .\nAll this initiatives has made us all over the years a recognised ecological community .\nGood morning

becoming cheaper and also more safe but some people prefer cars to extent do we agree with and what is our reasons for that that is what are we going to demonstrate in this essay\nbefore about 40 years there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars so in those years there was not even good facility to move from place to other and that is because there was no companies to build cars in about 10 years cars trading became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans at the beginning the faced a lot of problems but they were able to solve it by the end\nnowadays all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cars to buses even trains and planes .some people prefer cars because the do like crowded places or because the find it sometimes cheaper but from another point of view public transportation is very cheap and even faster but when it comes to traveling a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy more by chilling out from crowded places\nto summaries it is different from some oneis opinion to another i predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more that by the end cars will disappear and will will no longer be used\nThe topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country .\nThis conclusion become more

the city .\nIn conclusion , I would suggest to our neighbour cities to taking part of cleaning environment so one day it can be seen in whole country .\nEverybody has his favourite sport .\nMy

developed and become an arid place when she was a child .\nAfter she grows up , she decides to leave and never go back to her hometown .\nIn addition , she has no blithe memory in her childhood .\nOne problem is that some people will consider the job opportunity that it might bring to us .\nDue to the mineral development , many people in our hometown can probably earn much more money than before .\nIt seems like a sought - after chance .\nNevertheless , they do not give us any promise of the vacancy .\nIn addition , money is no more crucial when it comes to health and environmental conservation .\nIn a nutshell , Based on the reasons and instances above , the disadvantages of extract the valuable mineral are outweigh the advantage .\nTherefore , I do not subscribe to this decision .\nLimiting cars on the roads would cause the disappearing of poo .\nThe fossil fuels used by vehicles cause global warming .\nGlobal warming is a serious issue , higher temperatures make the ice caps melt .\nThe longer we burry our heads in sand , the warmer the Earth will be .\nI learn English to improve the general quality of my sentences !\nI do n't believe in it , especially while cars are not flying .\nEven if it will have happened there are many people who ca n't get a car , because it is too exspensive , not only for buying but for fuel , service and so forth .\nBuses are more simple - you just buy a ticket .\nAnd what about trains ?\nI saw tv about train in Japan - that is the future of public transport .\nI want to see blue sky and not stream of cars like it was in the film \" The Fifth Element \"\nBrandon Mackie", "Parliament House\nCambera ACT 25089\nThe 26th of March 2015\nChief Executive Officer\nCarlos Alberto Marrero Zaragoza", "Dear Carlos\nYour order 6 air conditioning is incomplete , we apologize for the inconvenience .\nWe have conscience of this mistake , we had a confusion of the number of air conditioning before the telephone conversation with your secretary to confirm your purchase .\nBecause your order was confirmed at too late and I that the order was n't in advance we only could send 5 pieces .\nSince the units were sold in inventory but your purchase indicates that 6 pieces were confirmed , do not worry about it , we will send you the remaining unit as soon as possible .\nWe hope you keep preferring us .", "Yours Sincerely .", "Brandon Mackie\nMy name is Chew .\nI'm 25 years old and I 'm come from Malaysia .

that carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of mile an hour and boat that much bigger and faster than ancient time .\nAlthough compared to ancient time we are lucky enough that we have all these option .\nHowever , if I have given option to choose between all of three , I will say plane .\nThere are three reason to choose this .\nFirst reason is its speed , compare to both other means of transportation it can travel faster .\nIt can travel thousand of miles in a couple of hours .\nAs a result people can save their time .\nSecond is safety , compared to other the chances of accident is less .\nThat makes it safer to travel by plane rather than the train or boat .\nThird one is comfort level .\nPlan is much more more comfortable than both train and boat .\nIn conclusion , I will say that plan will be my first choice in all of three means of transportation .\nThe reason behind my choice is speed , safety and comfort level that make plan as my first choice .\nEveryone should take a

worth learning a foreign language ?\nFirstly , there are more multinational companies that need people to speak other languages , so that means that the people who know to speak foreign language have more opportunities to get a job in important companies , or will have more chances of being promoted .\nOn the other hand , are more benefits , for example , if you want to travel to another a country is very useful to know a different language , because you can understand all without complications .\nFinally , learning another language gives the learner the ability to step inside the mind and context of that other culture .\nToday globalization is bringing the world more close , that means that there are more possibilities to have contact with the other cultures , for example in literature , poetry , films , TV programs , music or some other aspect of the culture .\nOn balance , learning foreign languages is very positive on different aspect , so if you have the positivity of learning a new language do it , because it will bring you many benefits .\nA LETTER OF COMPLAINT", "Julio Camarillo\nMontano avenue n\u00ba2\nPost Code 10237 C\u00e1ceres\nAugust , 23rd 2014", "Dear Sir / Madam

procedures of making bank notes .\nDesgin the bank notes are the first and indispensable step .\nPeple should decide the background colour and thw artwork while they have to consider the security issues .\nThen , skilled machinists would prepare the metal plates in order to go to the next step .\nThe third section is to print the prepared bank notes .\nUsually there will be 50 ban notes per sheet .\nThe colour will print on the both sides and every notes has their unique ink also the images will be slightly raised .\nAfter that , it comes to the most significant stage , that is inspect the quality of the printed sheets .\nPeople usually divided the quality into three parts : Good quality , Partially damaged , and bad sheets .\nAs for good quality sheets and partially damaged sheets but still good , people will cut them separately and pack them together in order to dispacting and distributing the bank notes .\nIf the partially damaged sheets are bad , they will be treated as bad

T\nhe price for independent transport will grow dramatically .\nI reckon that that will change the habits of the public .\nEven though we will have to read the timetable and to learn again to be on time , the nice old train could become important again .\nImagine this picture : the first class of this semester , students are yawning and do not pay attention on the teacher ; while the teacher ask for the answer , students can not answer because they totally can not remember what they have studied in last semester .\nStudents could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying partly because of after the long vacation , students will not remember the knowledge they have learned , partly because of long vacation will let students used to have fun instead of study , and partly because of some difficult courses should be continually studying .\nTherefore , I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .\nMore reasons and detail will be shed light on in the following paragraphs .\nTo begin with , there is a general consensus , students will forget the knowledge they have learned after a long break time .\nFor example , on history class , history teacher have to repeat teaching the history of North America before he start to teach the history of South America in the beginning of the semester .\nIt is very wasting time and not efficient .\nNext to go would be , students get used to relax by having no study and homework in the long vacation .\nFor example , when the semester start , students can not get away from the sunshine , beach , and travelling .\nIn the class , students will recall the joyful time they had instead paying attention on the teacher .\nLast but not least , some difficult courses should be continually studying rather than having long a break time .\nFor instance , learning English should be a daily education , if you have a long time without learning English , you could forget the vocabulary or the grammar .\nIn a nutshell , based on aforementioned , I totally I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .\nMy favourite sport is the soccer .\nI enjoy this sport since I was a child , I always remember when my father and my brother teach me to play it .\nMy father was a professional soccer player so I think that I inherited this love for the soccer .\nI played soccer in different teams in my neighborhood , school or university .\nI always enjoy playing soccer because when I am in the playing field I forget all problems .\nI like to speak with my team partners .\nTogether we analyze the rival team and we choose a strategy to win the match .\nwhen I play bad I feel nervous but my parters give me their unconditional support .\nthat is priceless .\nI know the health is very important so if you practise this sport there is a big probability that you are healthy .\nSo if you are starting this sport you have to do it because you really like it .\nif you do n't like it there are many options to practise whatever sports .\nThe soccer is not a violent sport but sometimes it becomes .\nIn this way you have to be prepared for anything problem .\nFinally I advise that you enjoy playing this awesome sport .\nOn my vacation I went to New York .\nI also went to the amazing Niagara Falls .\nSomething that made me happy was to see my family .\nOn september 12th,2014 I went to New York city .\nIn the fly I was very happy because I received a lot of food .\nThe flight was approximatly five hours where I watch beautiful movies .\nWhen I arrived my uncle was waiting for me and I gave him a big hug .\nWe went to long island because there he lives .\nHe have a really nice house and I was happy to see my little cousin \" Angel \" who looks just like me .\nIn New York I eat so much , I also went to the city thay never sleeps , Manhattan .\nMy uncle had the awesome idea of going to Niagara Falls .\nWe went in car and it was about 8 hours long .\nFinally we arrived to Niagara Falls city that looks like a ghost place .\nIt does not have too much to do but there were the falls .\nI was amazed of how huge were the falls .\nThey were incredible amazing and beautiful .\nI take too much photos because you do nt visit places like that everyday .\nSomething that made me very happy was to visit my family .\nMy uncle Juan lives in United States of America and I was very to hug him because I miss him a lot .\nMy cousin Angel was very happy to see me and me too , we are like siblings .\nMy aunt gave me a lot of presents because she say they do not see me frecuently and many other part of my family .\nIn conclusion I have a perfect vacation where I saw new things , visit awesome places as Niagara Falls and Time Square , recieving a lot of presents and soecially eat a lot delicious food .\nMost attending students to Universities are out of the city where they used to live , so , they need an accommodation to live through their study years .\nMost universities provide cheap accommodations such as , shared rooms and dormitories to their students to lower the living costs , where most students have low income .\nOther students who may have family financial support prefer to hire an apartments to live independently\nSharing houses or rooms have many advantages such as , cheap , safe , close to the university , and learn how to share everything with others . saving money and time will be more Obvious in university dormitories because monthly payments will be less than four times than hiring an apartment , and because it will be closer to the university , saving money and time is more efficient by reducing transportation 's costs\nIn spite all these benefits , I prefer- if I can - to live in an apartment where the personality is very important for me .\nMany years ago , I shared a friend in a room for few months during a course outside my country , these days where I worst during my life , he was dirty , speaking loudly all time and did not share the budget of eating . living alone will grant me the freedom to live by the way that I choose and still friendly with all the others without exceed the privacy of my friends . this matter will not achieved when living in shared rooms .\nthey annoying me", "Although The federal government which is decided as a role of USA has many benefits according to reading passage , the lecturer believes that there is no perfect government .\nThe powerful of the federalism which has more liberty for the states to have their own policies according to their needs , is not always good for the lecture where it may create some conflicts between the states .\nAn example of that is the marriage of homosexual where some state admit this marriage , others do n't .\nAlso , the reading passage declares that even the federal government let each state function independently , it still control on the main decisions .\nthis case causes some problems where the lecturer mentioned the failure of federal government to stop illegal immigration to USA through Nevada desert .\nalso the control of the federal government is the reason why each of the state and the federal blame each other in the increase of the unemployment in some states\nIn conclusion , federal government which give freedom and powerful , cause many problems such as no single policy and confusion in the responsibility .\nTravelling to a different country can be both exciting and frustrating at the same time .", "I think that any type of trip is exciting but also have their frustrating moments .\nIn order to enjoy travelling to Mexico I would give two important advice ; first try to get alone with travel companion and enjoy Mexican food instead to critic about spicy savor .\nPeople say that in every voyage the people suffer to different moments of the trip : arrived , get away to the frustration of an unknown place , get alone with your trip companion , success as a traveler and arrived home triumphal .\nIn order to enjoy a trip to Mexico I suggest that the traveler find a manner to get alone with his or her companion .\nThis minimal chance would make a big difference when you visit other city .\nAs an example , if you are able to get alone with your travel companion could enjoy each moment of the trip , exchange some pictures , eat together , and visit places with common interest such as museums or malls .\nOther advice that I would give to people coming to Mexico is that enjoy for Mexican food .\nMexican food has a lot of tasting dishes from different states of the country .\nFor example , there are a lot of American people that does n't like spicy food and also most of the times could get angry with the excess of pepper that the Mexican people used to use to prepare their food .\nAs advice I would suggest you to ask for sauces with lower pepper .\nIn this way the visitors would be able to enjoy Mexican food with less pepper and the same delicious savor that is so characteristic of our country .\nIn conclusion , I offered two important advice for visitors that coming to my country : Try to get alone with their companion in order to have fun and try to enjoy Mexican food because it is delicious !\nAfter the Internet was invented and revealed first time in August 29th 1969 , Social Media Site ( SMS ) is the next most significant innovation that has partly replaced for face to face communication .\nSMS such as Facebook send out 700.000 messages , and 170.000 Tweets are publicized on Twitter each 60 seconds .\nUnsurprisingly , social consequences of Facebook and Twitter plays an important role in communication , regardless of distance or time .\nHowever , people who use Facebook , Twitter or SMS in general , are not likely to have their own personal privacy that there is a possibility of cycle of bullying .\nThis essay will force on benefits and disadvantages of Facebook and Twitter , and also comments potential future of these implications .\nCommunicating can be achieved , regardless of distance , through Facebook and Twitter .\nThe benefit of being from being connected globally to Facebook and Twitter is that messages can be transmitted almost instantly to viewers .\nFirstly , Facebook and Twitter can be used when their users are in an unpleasant mood , and in where their negative feelings are expressed .\nSecondly , Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in touch with daily activities from friends , making observations of relationships , maintaining one 's own feeling within the network ( through wall posts , pokes , messages , etc ) ( Oldmeadow , Quinn , & Kowert , 2013 ) .\nThat is to say , human behaviour on Facebook are interacted we with others by sharing their mood , and receiving responses .\nThirdly , Facebook can be used as an organizational communication tool in business .\nKnowledge about the members increases continually , and moreover , maintaining relations with other existing members , and also sharing their same interests by the social network .\n( Emerald Group Publishing , 2013 ) .\nFinally , people are allowed to follow anyone who they find enjoyable through Twitter .\nFor instance , by following famous celebrities , people can easily see every daily activities which are posted by them .\nHowever , due to this , people who are being followed , or users in general , may have less personal privacy , and also there is a high potential of being purposely aggressive toward someone .\nHowever , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily response as a public opinion .\nHowever , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily response as a public opinion .\nMostly Facebook users expect their friend to respond or pay attention on what they are doing .\nIn fact , along with agreeable and pleasant comments , there are also small amounts of aggressive and even racist comment .\nFirst of all , people can post any racist comments which target a specific group or person .\nFor example , after the premier of The Hunger Game was released , a fan posted an onset racist tweet that saying that they were unhappy because one of the main actresses was performed by Black person ( Rauch and Schanz , 2013 ) .\nBecause of the accessible information through SMS , it has led to many problems involve with cycle - bullying , cycle - badgering , cycle - stalking behaviour ( Krishna , as cited in Williams & Merten , 2008 ) .", "For example , Krishna et al.(2013 ) reports a case of continuous disturbing a woman from a man called Mr .\nX \" admitted to a state psychiatric hospital after being found not competent to stand trial on charges of stalking harassment , trespassing and telephone harassment \" ( pp .", "576.e1 - 576.e2 ) .\nPotentially , Facebook and Twitter , and SMS in general , may replace face to face communication and improve their functions , because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without have to view each other appearances .\nTherefore , it would be easier to be connected and keep in touch with friends within a second , rather than have to call them .\nThe possibly outcomes might be the more time people spend on SMS , the less communicate skills that they have .\nIn addition , to decrease the risk of negative comments or posts , Facebook and Twitter would improve their futures to solve the less personal privacy problem .\nFor example , controlling what posts should be sent by adding more privacy options .\nHowever , despite the useful of these implications , people should pay attention that Facebook and Twitter could affect their social life by avoid using it most of the time .\nIn conclusion , the benefits from using Facebook and Twitter is that people can communicate and being connected to their friends frequently .\nAlso people can easily reduce their negative mood by sharing and expressing how they feel .\nIn contrast , because Facebook and Twitter have been connected worldwide , which means protecting personal privacy is probably impossible .\nPossibly , users might express aggressive toward each other , because of lack of privacy .\nPhotography classes for everyone", "Introduction\nTeenagers are constantly influenced by social networks like Facebook , Instagram , Pinterest , etc .\nPhotographs are included in all of those sites .\nAlso , this phenomenon of taking photographs is part of our daily life , because it is the best way to capture special moments like birthdays , travels , special ocassions , etc .\nAs a new college subject\nThis practice is considered those activities that anyone can do without any kind of special preparation .\nHowever , teaching students how to apply better techniques in the moment of taking a picture should be consider as learning to draw .\nBoth skills are required in today 's world and are necessary to be developed in the education system at the same level .\nThe reasons\nRecent studies show that in the last twenty years more than 3,000 photographs are taken per person in the world , especially in the latest generations lifes(teenagers and kids ) .\nThis increase is related with the overwhelming development of technologies in computers , cameras , cellphones , etc .\nAlso , photography is considered as a type of art , so it requires the knowledge of especial skills , techniques and knowledge .\nWhat a lovely weather today !\nWhat a wonderful day ! There is an April now and finally spring came .\nA bright sun is shining , the snow melted away in March .\nThe first spring birds came back from the warm countries .\nThey are singing funny and building their nests .\nPeople look happier .\nThey are feeling tired after a long snowy winter .\nWe set our clock forward one hour in March .\nThe summertime was first introduced in England in 1908

think that your life style will improve ?\nWell you are mistaken .\nFor doing different kind of sports you need to be skilled or willing to try new things .\nWhat if you do n't have none of those requierments ?\nThen you know hockey is the aswner .\nhockey is a sport I have played for many years and it turned out to be my favorite .\nIt 's a good way of learning how to communicate and work with people . in simple words ,\nit 's a team sport .\nHowever it 's not always as simple as it sounds .\nYou have to train five days a week and you need to concentrate a lot .\nOn the other hand I enjoy every second of it .\nThrough all my life I have been willing to improve in this sport and since 2010 it has became a life style to me .\nWhy will I recommend this to you ?\nIt would definitely help you to grow and improve as a person .\nHockey will change the way you see the world and you are going to start seen it with other eyes .\nSo stop searching for the right sport , this one is for you !\nAs far as I 'm concerned , public transportation is the best transport media for environmental care .\nIn spite of some people make enough money to buy their own car , electric and hybrid cars are more expensive than traditional ones ( the ones who use gas or diesel ) so , people choose this ones and that 's because pollution is several issue that we have to deal with .\nThe environmental care is taking strength every day , from kids too ancient people .\nThe government and many companies are measuring the CO2 emissions which are being produced by industrial or service processes that are necessary for producing goods for the social consume .\nIf people do n't use public transportation , they could walk , ride a bike or buy a traditional car , and that will probably take place when the destiny is far from the place where you live .\nFrom my point of view , public transportation will be very important in the future , especially in developed countries .\nI think the government will slow down the fee in public transportation , that could make people to use public transportation and caring the environment from CO2 emissions and prevent the global heating .\nIn Coslada City Council , people are well informed about taking care environment .\nThe city council has developed several campaigns to improve the awareness of its citizens , for example , the children learn at school how to separate the waste .\nThere are many ecological islands .\nEach of them has three or four kinds of bins and they are not as far as two hundred meters .\nThere have been several planting campaigns to plant trees and to clean the river Jarama side .\nNevertheness it is never enough , because dog 's owners that they have most of the blame .\nSince 2008 , there are many bike paths across the city , so the citizens will be able to avoid the car and they will emit less air pollution .\nThe organic waste is picked up every day and plastic and paper waste is picked up every other day .\nThe most important thing in the environment care is the education of children .\nOur planet is in such a difficult situation that we have to take over the problem .\nA problem which was caused by us , human beings , with their target of making money without thinking of the effects .\nMy family is very conscious of this trouble so we make any effort to solve it .\nWe usually use the public transport , which has a great quality in the city I live .\nIt works perfectly : it is always on time and the price is worth .\nWe live in a cottage and we have several bins which are clasified according to the material we want to recycle .\nMoreover , we run an organization which pays people who bring us the materials to recycle .\nThe benefits are given to several organizations which take of care of the environment .\nMy sister teaches people what to do with things they want to rid of , such as bottles or papers .\nShe is able to do such beautiful jewellery that lots of people are following her !\nIt shows that this kind of things can have a second life .", "As soon as the last river ends the southern border of Egypt is here .\nThe Nile river is the origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization that counts over 6 thousand years .\nAll historians , researchers , scientists agree with this .\nAnd as for me , I totally support their point of view .\nEgypt is a kind of the river civilization among the huge desert Sahara .\nAll over the time the Nile is the only source of water for Egyptians .\nFurthermore , elevation of the water level on the river helps people to realize the possibility of expanding the area of fertile lands .\nThe Egyptians called their country ' Black Land ' to mark it off of the red soil of desert .\nNowadays , deep and wide valley of the Nile became the most important transport line for Egypt .\nThrough the centuries people have been exploring the nature of the Nile .\nThe ancient Egyptians divided the year for three seasons compared

as well as positive .\nThe great amount of dams were built on the river that caused the disappearing of a lot of plants and animals .\nAnyway , a lot of Egyptians still living far from the main water artery of the country and hardly can find the clean water to drink .\nBut I hope , as soon as Egypt become developing the government will pay attention to the ecological problems that high level

.\nFor centuries this building had been the symbol of this city .\nIt quite ancient , but still fascinating for thousand of tourists , who come every year .\nIt was built in 79 A.C. by Tito , who was the Roman emperor .\nIt was used for shows with animals or humans , who were killed without pity .\nMoreover navy wars were represented in order to celebrate Roman army .\nIt is ruined through the ages , but now people understand his importance and take care of it .\nIn my opinion it is important because it remembers our past and our traditions , which we should n't forget .\nHowever not all people are aware of it .\nIt 's our strength and every time I go beyond I realize how many people succeeded in building it .\nThat 's why it is important : it makes us understand to never give up and follow our dreams .\nIn this fast moving world transport has become an important factor for everyday activities .\nEverybody needs a mode of transport to earn their daily living .\nThere is no point in saying public transport has no future .\nTravelling through car is a convenient mode of transport , but most of the population can not afford it .\nThere are advantages and disadvantages in using a public transport .\nFirstly to discuss the benefits of public transport it is cheap and affordable for all class of people in society .\nVariety of buses are released by the government in order to meet people 's financial conditions .\nUsing public transport is a time waste and no privacy are some of the disadvantages .\nSimilarly travelling by car has its own advantage and disadvantages .\nEverybody can not afford a travel through car as it is costly , but to discuss the benefits , one can enjoy high privacy during travel and is convenient\nand sophisticated and can travel faster .\nTo sum up with it is not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because both has equal advantage and disadvantages .\nSometime I think that Taipei is too crowded .\nThere is no denying that the MRT in this city is such a convenient metropolitan system .\nHowever , during the rush hour , there are always have such a ruin person who has no public awareness at all .\nThey occupy too many seats , inclouding priority seats .\nFurthermore , most of them are students .\nThey do n't respect other passengers , just keep laughing and teasing each other , despite the fact that some people have told them not to do this .\nMoreover , I think that provide the seat to elders is also a problem .\nPriority seats , are preserved to those who need , not only elders but also some adult need it .\nSomehow , not all of them can you identify whether their bodies feel uncomfortable merely from their appearance , which lead to Some misunderstanding between them .\nSome people even blame them for they occupy the seats instead of offer the seat .\nMoreover , some old people would take this considerative action for granted and they would even command young adults or students offer their seat without manners !\nIn my opinion , the transportation in our city have nothing to criticize expect that .\nEveryone should develop the awareness of public manner .\nTelevision is an important part of modern culture .\nWe depend on television for entertainment , education , news and films\nTV has much benefits :\nFirstly it enables young people to share cultural experiences with others .\nTV can act as a catalyst to get kids reading - following up on TV programs by getting books on the same subjects or reading authors whose work was adapted for the programs .\nTelevision can teach kids important values and life lessons .\nEducational programming can develop young children 's socialization and learning skills .\nNews , current events and historical programming can help make young people more aware of other cultures and people .\nDocumentaries can help develop critical thinking about society and the world .\nTV can help introduce youth to classic Hollywood films and foreign movies that they might not otherwise see .\nCultural programming can open up the world of music and art for young people .\nBut television have also negative effects : First of all , children who spend a great deal of time watching television get less exercise .\nIn addition , these children receive less socialization with other children .\nTelevision also takes away from family time .\nThis is also true for families who eat in front of the television .\nI deal with consulting and sales of financial products and services to an international bank , in the mass - market and small - business .\nI follow the relationship with customers from acquisition to the advise until the realization of contracts , building and maintaining relationships after - sales in the aim of customer

several years to the acquisition of new customers , to provide them with a complete service , from the account to insurance products , investment products , personal loans , revolving credit , and cross - selling products .\nIn many years of work I have honed my skills in managing non - standard situations , analyzing the problem , finding and implementing practical and easy solutions .\nnon - standard situations , analyzing the problem , finding and implementing practical and easy solutions .\nI have faced several situations always work with serenity and enthusiasm , I like to work in a multicultural and dynamic .\nI 'm careful to meet the goals of the team in which I work , cooperating with colleagues to achieve the goals by providing my skills , always willing to learn , respecting

I 've also got the rescue licence , I worked as a lifeguard in the summer studying for the patent padi dive master\nNowadays we all hope , that public transport can save the world .\nWhen we see all this cars in our yards , when we stay in traffic jam , we think that one day we will have to live our car and use public transport .\nIf we do n't do it , one day we 'll wake up in the immortal traffic jam .\nBut , probably , this situation is only period of development of transport .\nWe are told about a lot of innovations in this spheare .\nFor instance , Google reported about Googlemobile .\nMaybe , robots will be able to drive more smart then people .\nIf they will contact each other and use Googlemap or something like that , they will be able to avoid accidents on the roads .\nSo people will be able to avoid traffic jams .\nNot all people like the idea of Googlemobile .\nSome people think , it might take away their independence .\nBut another of people think that it is not so bad idea , because they will be able to drink in spite of the fact , that they are drivers at the moment .\nHowever , there will always be people who dislike to be a driver anyway .\nAnd people who hate public transport , there will always be .\nThe question is , which sort of people have more impact in the world , and , finally , who will decide .\nHow many language do you speak ?\nDid you ever think of learning another foreign language ?\nOr do you want to be a polyglot ?\nToday it is miles time important to learn a foreign language than before .\nthere are few reasons whcih show you why it is important to learn a foreign language today .\nFirst , if you are planning to travel to another country , it is absolutely useful to speak local language , it makes your trip more easy and comfortable .\nSecond , for finding a good job opportunity , the business exchange is increasing in the intrenational level , if you speak a foreign language , certainly it adds some value on your profile and you can get a higher salary .\nThird , through learning a foreign language , you do n't only learn a language , at the time you are also getting know its culture , get to know a different culture and society different than yours 's , it enriches your knowledge .\nOver these years , there are more and more miserable accidents happened around the world .", "From newspapers , magazines , even foreign medium , we can easily figure out that our environment is changing severely .\nMany scientists infer that people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years because of humans ' greedy .\nHumans always desire to have a more convenient and comfortable life , but forget to protect and cherish the Earth at the same time .\nHigh - technological countries have developed a great number of forests and lands to build high buildings .\nVarious factories emit excessive carbon dioxide into the air .\nAll the examples above will enhance the temperature and make the Earth hotter and hotter .\nThe higher temperature enhance , the worst the living quality is .\nIf people around the world could n't put more emphasis on our living places , we must have a dark and hopeless future .\nDue to the climate change , the weather is so hot that people could even have a water shortage .\nLosing enough water supply , people 's body will become weak and rough .\nIn this living situation , instead of laughter and happiness , there will be more fight , hatred and sadness .\nEveryone lives in despair , but can not find the entrance to brightness .\nThe terrible consequences , are caused by the humans ' unsatisfied heart .\nFriends , from now , let us be the members to protect and take care of our Earth !\nIt was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .\nThe undercovered work is very hard , not just because you will work with dangerous people , the really danger is if you get discovered .\nWhen people know that they were deceived , that they trust were broken , heads will roll .\nYou have to be precise , fast , and a really good actor .\nThe passion for the cause is the key to survive .\nIt is just something that I had to do , not you , not her , me .\nI did n't choose that , this job has chosen me .\nDear Sir or Madamme ,\nI would like to apply for the position of beach lifeguard assistance which I saw advertised .\nFor the last two years I have joined the swimming group at the University .\nI managed to succeeded in many competitions in the country and abroad .\nI believe I am a suitable candidate for this post , considering the swimming skills I have .\nOn the other hand I completed the first aid course , in the Red Cross .\nThe job would give me the opportunity to use all the experience I have gained and what is more It would provide me new knowledge .\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me if you should require further information .\nI am available to attend an interview at your convenience .\nI look forward to hearing from you\nYours faithfully ,\nSebasti\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez\nIn our modern world , many people are suffered from stress that spring from life conditions .\nIn addition to this , people are working in very stressful workplaces and they want to leave from this condition in holidays .\nTherefore , it can be said that holidays are the best option to renew the soul and revive the spirit for people .\nIn holidays , people can away from daily problems and also can take more time with their friends and family .\nIn this respect , many people prefer to go natural places with their families in order to forget about bad situations on their lives .\nFor example , walking in the seaside or swimming in the sea can be helpful to forget hard life conditions .\nOn the one hand , holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking clearly their experinces about life .\nPeople can review their decisions in holidays more accurate and helpful .\nFor instance , in stressful life conditions people can make bad decisions for their future .\nBesides , people underestimate emotional feelings in their workplaces .\nThe reason is that people must complate their tasks in order to gain more money to maintain their lives and they forget about these emotional feelings such as love , helping people or thinking spiritual things .\nIt can be clearly seen that in holidays people are getting closer and they remember their feelings .\nFor example , people meet their relatives that never see for a long time .\nAt the same time , people have a chance to go sacred places in order to renew their spirits and souls .\nThey can pray for God and it gives a relief for people .\nWhen people remember these emotional and spiritual subjects they can become more happy . Because people need to leave the material world .\nIn holidays , people have time to review their mistakes that leads to stressful life .\nIn conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people in order to heal their problems and stressful life conditions .\nAlso holidays are very helpful days in order to revive the spirit and the soul because people have a chance to move away modern life that has full of material subjects .\nCycling to school , to work or to do any other activity it is not a common habit in Spain .\nHowever , the government and the local councils of big cities such as Madrid or Valencia , are trying their best to promote this movement because they consider it a way of development .\nOn the one hand , there are many benefits of cycling .\nFirstly , it reduces traffic jams , noise and pollution , as well as it lowers CO2 emissions .\nFurthermore , it turns out to be the quickest method of transport .\nOn the other hand , there are some issues such as the increase of danger on the roads .\nStatistically cycling is generally considered to be more dangerous than travelling by car .\nAnother disadvantage is the weather .\nGetting wet when it rains , having to do a lot of effort to cycle into a strong wind , freezing weather or having to keep drinking when hot weather .\nIn my point of view , Cycling contributes to improve community spirit and it is possible to look for solutions to face the disadvantages of this activity .\nNo one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .\nFor example , people taking car do not need to spend time waiting for the bus or subway .\nAnd this undesirable time might be not so short during holidays , due to less frequent schedule .\nAlso , we can drive a car to any place where the public transport perhaps is not able not reach .\nWhen the bus is crowded , we have to stand , making us more exhausting especially for a long distance .\nEven though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above , advantages of travelling by public transport should not be neglected .\nFirst , public transport is good for the environment compared to private car .\nAs we all know , the more public transport passengers use , the less car exhausts are emitted per person .\nRecently , several studies have shown evidences that there is a strong relation between car exhausts and lung cancers .\nIn other words , public transport plays an important role in protecting human beings from suffering of diseases and saving life .\nSecond , public transport saves city spaces .\nAs more and more people choose to live in cities , nowadays our cities become larger and more crowded .\nCorrespondingly , the space for each person becomes more limited than before .\nProvided that every citizen owns a car and use it rather than public transport for every travelling chance , I suppose that our streets would become a parking place and everyone would spend more time in congesting .\nLast but not the least , public transport allows people to do other things which is impossible when driving .\nThe drivers have to continuously pay attention to surroundings , resulting in a tense spirit .\nFor a passenger , however , travelling is a complete relax .\nPeople can listen to music , take a phone call with a friend , read a fascinating book or just loot at outside .\nThough there are many advantages for public transport , it does not mean that public transport is the best choice for every situation .\nE.g. , it offers less flexibility than cars , and is less environment friendly than bicycles .\nTherefore , it is unreasonable to conclude that one transport can replace others .\nIt is better that people are aware of their pros and cons and choose a fit one .\nLanguages for the future\nShould learn other languages ? .\nWe live in a world that day to day changes and people need to develop their skills and overcome .\nI think there are many reasons to learn languages .\nOn the one hand it could allow you to communicate with people , know different cultures and travel around the word without the language barrier .\nAlso in recent years to express yourself in English , French , Germany and Russian has became something essential and very important in our lives to find a job .\nI think a great disadvantage is the price of the course .\nAlso I consider that it tends to be hard and takes time away from doing any other things .\nIt seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be profitability in the future but to achieve it the will have to be motivated and to enjoy learning .\nrua francisco xavier n\u00ba3 \u00f3bidos , 25 - 4 - 2014", "Dear Usa Summer Camps ,", "I am writing in response to your advertisement for a job .\nI had a part - time job as babby - sitter and I take care of my 11 years old brother very often .\nI worked in an Easter camp too and I have already prepared lot of ativities , like \" rappel \" , paintball ...\nThat is for these reasons I think I have the skills for the job .", "I can be contacted for a meeting in the above address .\nI hope you considerate me for the job , rodrigo\nToday , I went to my Winnie 's home with Adriana in the afternoon .\nWe ate delicious food and play interesting games altogether .\nWe had a great time .\nAt 2 o'clock in he afternoon , we arrived at Winnie 's home .\nFirst , we listened to some songs , such as almost and big big world .\nAfter thirty minutes , we had tea .\nWinnie loves eating very much so I can easily find much food at her home .\nWe had mouth- watering strawberry cakes and juicy apple juice for tea and they were extremely yummy .\nAfter having tea , we play hide - and - seek altogether in Winnie 's garden .\nAdriana and I hid behind a bench and Winnie looked for us .\nSuddenly , Winnie fell over a little stone .\nAdriana and I immediately came to her and held her up .

I never imagine that I was going to be so keen on football , but now it takes part of my life .\nI think football is a very exciting sport , and that everybody in the world should try it at least once in his or her life .\nOne thing you should keep in mind if you want to play football is that you have to be ready to reacive some punches .\nI recommend you a great restaurant which is in the shopping center .", "I have been there twice , and I like it .\nIts name is \" The English oven \" , and it 's a fantastic traditional and modern restaurant with British food .\nThe service is excellent and the waiters are so pleasant and gentle .\nThe interior is big , so all the class could stay inside without problems .\nThe decoration is modern and cozy , and it 's got some great traditional British objects .\nThe food is one of the best things in the restaurant that is always tasty and fresh .\nThe've got a lot of different dishes , traditional and modern .\nThey have also got a lot of different types of salads , pasta and pizzas .\nThe desserts are very good too .\nThey 've got original ones , like sweet pizza , and traditional .\nThere is a big variety of ice creams .\nThis restaurant is not too expensive , which is perfect for us , because we do n't want to spend too much money .\nThe restaurant is in the shopping center , so we can get there by bus or by train .\nI think this is the best restaurant to go on the end of the course , so we could book some tables as soon as possible because a lot of people usually goes there .\nDuring whole life , famous people , such as politicians and film stars , media are accompanying them .\nIn my view , public person deserve to have their own life , without photographing .\nIn one hand , becoming a public person associate with jornalist , mass - media , flashes .\nFamous people are obligated to provide their life in exemplary way .\nHowever , they still being ordinary people , they make mistakes .\nPeople are thought being jealous .\nNotice any kind of failures .\nIt seems to me that journalist might be absolutely toxic and they have defective infulence on society which assess celebrites through the prism of journalistic documentary .\nIn the other hand many of stars sold their privacy to earn more and more money .\nThe value of their talent , abilities are counted in amonut of tabloids scandals .\nSumming up , all over the world , are living famous people who do n't bring into the limelight their life .\nIt has ever been very useful for a long time ago , nevertheless nowadays , there are some people who ask if the public transport was suppressed , and society would save a lot of money .\nHowever , people should think about the large advantages , such as : people save money ; it is very comfortable and good for the environment .\nFirstly , the main reason is the cost because the people who do not have a car they need to travel or commute to another place and a car is very expensive .\nThe cars need to be repaired ; besides , if you have a car , you have to pay some taxes .\nIn addition , these people need to have public transport for travelling around the country and city .\nSecondly , another reason is the global warming because the atmosphere is much polluted .\nIf you use the public transport , you can be less contaminating than before because there are a lot of people who travel together in only one transport .\nFinally , the last reason is the comfort because you have a car ; it is so difficult to find a car park in the centre of the city .\nBesides in some cities , car can not be parked in some places , such as : the old city and the city centre .\nSumming up , people are aware of global warming and think about the high cost of having a car .\nFrom my point of view , I get used to walking around my city and my car is just used if I travel around the country .\nWe are living in a ever changing world .\nToday 's new things become things of past in few months .\nTake an example of mobile technology , your latest handset , with latest configurations becomes outdated within few months after buying it .\n50 years is a very long time and people lives will definitely change in such a long period .\nHowever , the important point to discuss would be whether it would be a positive change or negative one .\nLast 50 years science and technology took great leaps , internet , mobiles made us more connected .\nToday , we have all the information at finger - tips .\nToday , we do n't need to worry about getting lost at new place , Google maps are always there to help .\nWe need not to cram English words today , as we can quickly find meaning of any word on our mobiles .\nMeeting new people or selling your products , you do nt need to face anyone , everything can be managed through a virtual platforms .\nToday our lives have become much more comfortable than past , thanks to progress mankind has made in technology .\nOn the other hand a number of terrorism , global warming and greed became top challenges of today 's world .\nClimate changes due to global warming causing natural disasters now and then .\nTerrorist activities causing havoc in public live .\nCorruption and greed of people in power making it difficult to trust people leaders .\nIf these challenges are not addressed in coming years , imagining better lives for people in 50 years hence is rather difficult .\nWe need to remember technology is just a tool , in right hand it would be boon for us , in wrong hands it has power to destroy the world as we see it today .\nto who may concern ,", "I 'm an Italian girl who 's studying to improve her English .

was anxiety .\nHe could n't handle the feeling , when she tried to touch him , to kiss and hug him .\nHe knew that she loves him as much as he loves her , but everything was just too wrong on this moment .\nHer voice , her smile and even her body was to wrong on this moment .\nShe could n't understand what 's going on , because it was just three weeks ago when they had a conversation about kids and family and he said that he would like to have kids with her .\nAnd now , he just avoids her and he is not happy about the news .\nIt was a big mess .\nShe was more than happy and he could n't handle this news .\nThey both knew that they love each other and they care about each other , but it was too much for him .\nHe stood up and said to her girlfriend that he needs a break and he have to be alone .\nMichael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .\nTo the beginning I am going to take about what is my lovely sports and why I will enjoy the sport .\nIn fact , I do not like to do some sports during the anytime , but if I really need do some exercises that I like to go to swim in the swimming pool .\nFirstly , I think , swimming pool is clearing .\nSuch as after swimming that I have a safe and a bathroom to take shower .\nSecondly , I do not like to go to beach , this is because I do not like big sun and sand .\nThird , swimming in the ocean is most dangerous .\nHowever , I like to stay in the swimming pool during the summer .\nActually , I do not know how to swim but it is my favorite sport in my whole life .\nMoreover , I think before any kind of sports that we should do some exercises that is because we need to relax our bodies first . If we do not do it that we will get dangerous while we are doing any sports .\nIn conclusion , my opinion is I do not like to do any sports but we need to choose one kind of sport in our life and almost all people need to do it , as we could not stay at home or working all the time .\nEven you really do not like to do exercise that you can go to shop .\nThe purpose of this report is to outline the most important actions which have been taken in our town to protect the environment as the main issue to improve our quality of life .\nIn the first place , we need to pay attention to the fact that Caceres is located in a pasture area where local farmers have been breeding sheep , cows and pigs for centuries in spite of the hard weather conditions such as high temperatures and terrible drought in summer .\nAs a result , our water resources are difficult to be preserved and it is clearly necessary to maintain active campaigns to raise people 's awareness about the importance of a rational use of it .\nThe local government is also taking strong action on creating green areas in different places in or around the town where citizens can spend their free time or even do sports .\nThat 's the reason why it has been working on the recovery of some areas which are now parks or recreational areas .\nFinally , the town has also improved the management and treatment of waste system with the active cooperation of most of the citizenship who is really concerned about the recycling of waste need .\nIn fact , around 90% of Caceres inhabitants are said to sort and recycle their rubbish taking it out to the yellow , green and blue containers in every street .\nAnd that is the negative point , these dumpsters are too visible in town and it would be advisable to change the ones we have for underground ones .\nI woke up today and I just remember that I was doing a presentation about landscapes , and the ones that do it will reward a bonus point but anyways this is n't important information .\nI searched my family in the house and there was no one in the home , just me .\nI get a bit scared so I search them outside in the streets .\nI did n't knew that a bomb hit on the city and killed almost everyone , now I have to find my parents .\nI think the reason why I did n't know about the explosion is because this part where I live is a very poor area and it 's not that beautiful so you ca n't distinguish were does the explosion hit .\nFinally in some days I found some neighbors with some food , I was starving to death so I ate a lot .\nWe made some incentives about laws , but it was a total conflict , because the group noticed that some food was missing somehow .\nI think that someone drags some of the food on the night while everybody is sleeping .\nSo everybody is gon na try to enforce the laws .\nIn the next morning I ate a piece of steak and the group was talking about some creatures that were walking around to kill and eat us .\nIn the night I was thinking about many things just when I heard some noises .\nI stalked him and it seemed that this guy has a hump .\nI stomp him and when he turned around it was a woman from the group .\nWe were talking about this when a dog just came near ; it was adorable just when he converted into a big weird creature .\nHe bit my leg and it hurt a lot , we tried to alert the others but it was too late , it was the group or us .\nWe saw that beast eating our friends and the food .\nIn some ways that she robbed the food in the night and I wake up it was good for my survival .\nBut if I had the opportunity to reverse the trend of how am I going I would not do it because I have to face all of this .\nDOING EXCERCISE IS GOOD FOR YOURE HEALTH", "Why do you have to exercise ?\nWhat benefits do you obtain while exercising ?\nDo you know that 75% of people in Mexico , does n't practice any type of exercise , this is a big problem to our society and is the problem number 1 of why Mexico is the country with more obese in the world .\nDoing excercise it 's an important thing to do in a healthy and happy life , while you excercise you feel well with you re self an you re body .\nThere 's a lot of benefits that come in hand with doing excercise like reducing or take control of you re weight , it helps you with heart disease , problems with you re body , and also you can make a lot of friends while doing any exercise .\nNow days there 's a lot of different types of exercising , you can practice any sport , like soccer , basketball , baseball , or you can simply go to the GYM or practise Crossfit or something like that .\nSoccer it 's a great sport where you can make a lot of friends , you can stay fit , but you also need some skills because it 's not easy to controll the ball and dribble you 're rivals on the field .\nI recommend you to practise any sport you like and enjoy every second you spend exercising .\nThanks and start now , you wo n't regret it .\nIs there any future to public transport , for travelling by car is much more convenient ?\nMany disagree about the public transport whom are to be disappearing , though we still have to deal with different opinions about increasing in travelling .\nThis composition will explain the two different opinions .\nFirstly , the car is more convenient because there is privacy .\nAlso , unlike public transport such as buses and underground , you have much more comfort and speed .\nThere is a perception that a car can give you the freedom of choice .\nOn the website of The Scottish Government ( publication \" Young people and transport \" ) , a 12 - 14 years old boy explain \u00ab - I prefer going in the car , it 's quicker ...\nThere 's not as many people around you ... I prefer the car because you can listen to music as well . \u00bb\nAlthough they are many positive points about private cars , they are also negative ones .\nIndeed , cars increases the pollution , you have traffic congestion , and it is very expensive . \u00ab - On my wage , even the driving lessons are expensive .\nThen just owning a car and looking after your car , insurance , tax , etc .\nObviously it would benefit me if I worked in Edinburgh , but I do n't work in Edinburgh .\n\u00bb says a 17 - 22 years old boy .\nNow , secondly , travelling by public transport is cheaper ( we do n't pay any fees on public transport , but also , it is safer ,\nAccording to The Saigon Times , there are a lot of traffic accidents which occurred to private cars .\nThe main reason is that the cars ' owners are drunk when driving .\nIt is clear that if they took a bus or a taxi when they were drank , it would not have as much accidents .\nFinally , many developed countries on the world , such as England , America , Canada , Japan and so on , have built a public transport system , so the traffic jam have been decreased .\nAs a result , the economy has been increasing .\nFrom this analysis , it isobvious that travelling by public transport is very important .\nTopic :\nDo you agree or disagree \" Always telling the truth is considered the most important thing in a relationship \" ?\nDisagreement on always telling the truth be the most important point in a relationship will be my opinion .\nEven though being truthful is crucial in relationship , always telling the truth would be considered as hurting others ' feelings and is unwise .\nAnother reason for not telling the truth all the time is if it is about personal matter and it would feel like awkward to mention to colleagues or the employer .\nIt is better to tell a little white lie at this moment .\nTo further illustrate the first point above , could hurt one 's feelings by telling the truth at all time .\nFor example , if some woman you are acquainted wearing inappropriate clothes not fitting in the occasion .\nPeople usually tend not telling her the truth since it could make her feelings .\nInstead of doing so , people may praise her with other things on her .\nIn that case , they could still make conversions without boiling her mood .\nThe other point is when it comes to personal matters , people usually intend to keep it private since most of the time it is strange and inappropriate to talk oneself too much to people at work or even people that one just got acquainted .\nIf there are questions about things one do not want other people to know , they might say a little white lie which usually does not matter too much .\nIf I was having a day off to go to a doctor , I would prefer other people from asking details about it by say that I just had some errands to run .\nThese are the two opinions of mine on telling the truth or not .\nLast Friday , Michael and I was in the school playing happily with each other in the classroom .\nWhen we were in the class , suddenly Michael walked towards the door .\nMichael closed the door and knew at the moment he made a mistake .\nDue to this , we're both called to meet the headmaster .\nI could n't understood why we needed to meet the headmaster just because Michael had closed the door .\nThe door was n't broke into pieces or fell down .\nMy curiosity had put me into a big trouble .\nI asked the headmaster in a polite way and hopefully he can gave me the answer I wanted .\nHowever , things do n't happened like what I hoped .\nI ended getting expelled from the school because teacher and the classmates suspected Michael and I steal our classmate - Sally 's wallet .\nI could n't imagine the teacher and friends also pointed at us firmly and without given any chance for us to speak out .\nI finally realised that everything was a trap and we 're the unlucky and innocent ones as we fell into the trap .\nWe wiped off our tears , and waved our hands when we left the school .\nAlthough , one day later the headmaster found out the truth through CCTV , but we refused to return to the school and decided to change a new school as we know even if we go back this time , similar cases could happen next time .\nThis is because the teacher has a biased mindset .", "Dear USA summer camps ,\nmy name is Bianca Padovesi , and I have read your advertisement for the job .\nI consider I am the right person for this job because , firstly , I speak fluent and clear English which is very important to communicate .\nAlso , I have a good

needs supplies he would find some supplies and ammo to survive .\nWe start our journey and going in the forest , there was a lot of # pests on our way there were various guys that were sick we could n't do anything except for , keep going , I was seeing my little group to # diminish and some of us were # allergic to some plants , I was the only one that had no problem with all the other stuff people had problems with .\nI thought that maybe my # genes were actually immune to the infection I could actually be the # revolutionary guy that helps everyone that was in my # skeptick and I was really positive about it but # notwithstanding , I would n't actually sacrifice myself I have to think about is it help the entire world or just save a group the decision was in my hands it was # conventional to help the entire world but I do n't want to die . while I was thinking about that we found a body it was a familiar body from someone that was in the group one of those guys we wanted to find and alive not dead his face was all rotten and eaten away by the walkers .\nWe needed to find the ones that were still alive or at least tells us what happened to everyone , the # battle against hunger started everyone was hungry and we haven't eaten anything in a few days and that could lead us to two things dead or eaten away by a walker so we needed to find something that was a # nutritional based food where we could eat with no problem and be ok .\nWe found a pharmacy and a restroom where we could get a rest and take a shower to clean ourselves .\nWe got close to the pharmacy there was no walkers inside so we run into the pharmacy and closed all the doors and I got someone to check us in the night I needed some rest and went to sleep immediately .\nIn my area there are many railway lines and they 're often overcrowded .\nBut private traffic in this town is yet more present , as the result that Turin is the town of FIAT , the well known factory .\nNear to your home , there are many supermarkets in which you can easily buy all that you need to live .\nWhen you have to pay the telephone and energy bills , you can do that in any tobacco shops near to your home .\nIf you like shopping , in the perimeter of the town , there are some big supermarkets , which hold many items of the main great factories of Europe and above .\nLike all the industrialised countries , a connection to the Internet is granted almost for each area and each building .\nAt the end , the taxi are present and they cover all the town , but this service is less organised and developed than the English one .\nThere is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , film stars , politicians or people who work in music industry deserve to have a private life , deserve not to be under constant observation .\nTo my mind there should be a board between paparazzi work and a privacy of famous people .\nIn my opinion big stars should be able to relax and take some private time .\nAs far as I 'm concerned there is no one who feels comfortable when is under surveillance of people who wait to take pictures which shows them in embarrassing situation .\nUnfortunately , this is a part of celeb 's ' work ' so they have to take into account .\nBut on the other hand , there should be some inviolability spheres of life without journalists following them all the time .\nThis rarely fragments of life without an eye of a camera should be an opportunity to live like normal , not famous people .\nI know that catching celebrity doing celaning or taking a dog for a walk is a shocking news for people who read tabloids .\nTo my mind , they do not believe celebs are such a normal people as everyone of us only with more money in theirs bank accounts\nSo , as you can see I agree with the statement that famous people , who are recognizable , deserve to have a privte life and the ability of having normal life should be also given to them .\nThe Maze Runner\nI recently watched this new film based on one of the books of this worldwide known author .\nAs I have an interest in thrillers , I decided to give it a try .\nThe poster of the film already offered a sense of intrigue and mystery which made me take the decision to watch this film .\nThe film starts by putting yourself in the flesh of the main character , which is a 16-year - old boy who finds himself imprisoned in a cage and being transported to what it seems to be a camp .\nHe has no idea how he ended up there .\nHowever , he soon realizes that this is not a normal camp , which is located next to a giant and mysterious maze .\nThe people who lives in the camp take up different roles in order to survive and defend themselves from the menaces of the maze .\nHe took the role of a runner , the people responsible for exploring the maze and look for an exit of this place .\nStill , they only have the daylight time to explore the maze , as when the sun goes down it becomes very dangerous .\nThe film keeps getting better and better as you watch it , having its exciting moments when the characters discover something that hidden inside the maze .\nI heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to have a rush of adrenaline while enjoying a solid story which will leave no one indifferent .\nI 've been playing volleyball for 12 years now and hopefully many more , what I love about it is first of all that tall or small , anyone could play it as long as they 're determined so basically is a life long sport for everyone .\nI love the speed of volleyball , most of the time it 's quick and if you blink you probably missed something , each contact happens in less than a second , and still every player directs the location of the ball in that amount of time and then there 's the intensity , if you haven't seen a game go until 32 - 30 , and see the energy on the floor and hear the noise from the crowd you 're missing out .\nPersonally winning such a set makes me feel like I could do anything , but when I do n't , it still keeps me wanting more .\nI am always trying to jump higher , hit harder , pass and set better , and serve in more different ways .\nI live in New Eltham .\nMy area is very clean and very green .\nPeople there are very friendly and helpful .\nIt is a good place to live .\nOne time per week on Wednesday , robbish are taken .\nOf course garbage is sorted into different bins .\nThat is very good idea , because that robbish undergo a recycling .\nAll my neighbors in the same way collected garbage .\nEvery body care about cleanlinees in the front of the house and in the garden .\nEspecially spring is a lot of colours and pleasant odors .\nNew Eltham have beautiful parks where you can relax from the busy place .\nGreen time in my town is really fantastic .\nI have recently eaten at Black Bear restaurant , a typical Sicilian restaurant in Trecastagni , a little town near Catania located under the Etna volcano slopes , and I found that restaurant was easily the best I have eaten in .\nThere were two rooms , smoking room or non - smoking room .", "The surroundings were rustic , yet it still felt airy and cosy , the waiters were very friendly and

been present in our societies since ever .\nCannabis , heroin , speed are some examples of substances that are really well - known for all of us .\nLegalization of drugs is a very used argument by people who believe that this measure could solve the problem of the exclusion .\nMargination has a link with the illegality of this activity .\nAlso this illegality is the guilty for the attraction of the drugs because the majority of people start having drugs because they are young and its prohibition is very stimulating .\nThe real problem comes when this entertainment become in an addiction that can destroy our lives .\nI think everyone has proved some kind of illegal drug to have fun , enjoy friends or just to prove them , and I do not believe that behaviour is wrong because everyone needs to experiment and try new things .\nBut we have to be responsible and have very clear that it is only something exceptional and not our daily life because it is very dangerous as some people are not able to put deadlines to themselves .\nFinally , legalization of drugs means that they could be taxable and we know how the taxes work in our country so I do not know if it is a good idea or not .\nHi

public transport has become a major topic .\nThe idea of leaving public transportation aside is widely supported in developed countries , but this idea is rejected in developing countries , like the one I live in .\nAs a matter of fact , car ownership have increased over the last decades reducing the amount of people using public transport .\nThe possibility of travelling in their own cars is much more convenient than going by a bus full of people or even worse , the idea of wasting time in a long queue .\nNevertheless , you have another side to this reality .\nThere are people who can not afford to have their own cars or maybe they can afford to travel by any other means of transportation than the ones provided by the local government .\nThere are countries where gas is so expensive that people choose to pay the bus fee rather than paying for a full tank .\nSimilarly , people in countries with less income turn to these services because it is a way to reduce their overall expenses .\nTo conclude , the future of public transport will depend on the usage people give it .\nThere will be countries in which there will be no need for it , and in others where they will need it as long as their economy needs it .\nPeople need easy , fast and cheap solutions .\nIn general , using a car is easier then taking a train or a bus .\nIt 's just near your house or your office .\nYou do n't have to go to a station by walking , carrying weights , or suffering because of the rain or the snow .\nBut if you are sleepy , tired , bored , or simply you do n't like to drive , you can find easier to take a public transport .\nAnd also more enjoyable : you can relax listening to the music and looking around , or reading newspapers and books .\nIs the car faster then public transport ?\nIt depends .\nThe traffic can affect cars and buses at the same level .\nSometimes cars are faster then buses , sometimes buses are faster .\nSpeed trains are always faster then cars .\nSpeaking about money ? Travelling by car seems cheaper than public transport .\nBut , if we consider all the expenses ( buying the car , paying the insurance , etc . ) , maybe cars are not so cheap .\nIn fact , in every aspect there are pros and cons .\nWhat about the environment and the quality of life in the cities ?\nPublic transport is absolutely better .\nSo , even if travelling by car can be more convenient at a personal level , public transport has to be preferred by good citizens and strongly supported by governments .\nInformal letter for CAE ( PART 1 )\nDear Jan ,", "Thank you for your letter .\nI am delighted to hear you are thinking about working in the summer .\nFrom my experience working at the International company that organises music festivals , I can assure you that it will be of great use to you .\nI am not sure , however that this job will meet all your requirements . .\nIn my case , the only opportunity I got for such activity was on the 22nd of July , when they allowed for a relaxing day at the festival .\nHappily you will get the chance to practise your English skills .\nIn my case , I had to translate a good amount of texts , and also help English tourists to get around .\nThough if you are looking for additional work experience you will probably be disappointed .\nAll I was asked to do in the rest of the time was to take phone calls and make coffee for tourists .\nAll in all , the experience was beneficial .\nI made plenty of money , so I would n't worry about having enough for a nice holiday if I were you .\nWhen you decide what to do , do not hesitate to let me know !", "Take care of yourself ,", "Favius\nThe past few weeks have been really tough for Michael .\nThis whole business started to get on his nerves .", "He has to deal with it , the sooner the better .\nFor now one thing is clear as day - the one he is in love with is Malika , not Angelina .\nThe one he dates is Angelina , not Malika , that 's the problem .\nHe ca n't dump Angy just like that , they 've been friends for years .\nShe 's not bad .\nAnd he has to put stop to this without hurting anybody .\nSo yes , the decision is made .\nHe 'll break up with her .\nProbably , even tomorrow .", "It all started in such an idiotic way .\nThe door of his room was opened , he came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist and Angelina happened to pop in to borrow a lighter or matches or something to light up a cigarette .\nMike ca n't really say why they ended up having sex - perhaps , at the time he was pissed at himself for not having balls to get the girl he loved because of all these religious issues , Malika 's family and so on , but this is what happened .\nAnd that definitely was not the right thing to do .", "At the moment he did n't realise that .\nOnly after , when Angelina left , Michael closed the door and there he knew he had made a huge mistake .\nDear Sir or Madam ,", "I am writing to apply for the post of a summer camp councellor currently advertised on your website .\nAt the moment I have passed the second year of secondary school and I am waiting for the beginning of my final year .\nI hope I will get valuable experience by doing this job , which will be very useful in the future .\nI speak English , German and Polish and as a councelor it is very handy .\nI am very used to dealing with young people as last year I worked at a scout camp .\nMoreover , I used to work as a volunteer when still in primary school - once a week I would go to a local club to help children with their homework .\nI am hardworking , reliable and well - organised and I can take control of difficult situations .

You know\nwhat a file is ? \"\n\" Yes , sir . \"\n\" And you know what wittles is ? \"\n\" Yes , sir . \"\nMoreover , the vocabulary used by the narrator is opposed to what the characters said .\nPip uses a rich vocabulary , using a lot of mental verbs and abstract concepts that are usually inspired by concrete things .\nThe marsh pointed on the first chapter is good example .\nRegardless , the dialogues are written exactly as they were said .\nThe thief said \" Who d'ye with ? \"\nThis is written as it is said , making it more realistic .\nNotwithstanding , the way this novel is narrated is the protagonist .\nThe events are narrated in a mysterious way , telling us what happened in a realistic story - line without flashback .\nThe story is narrated as it happens .\nThe second chapter makes reference to the first and reveals something about the thief .\nAlso , the slow rhythm is adequate .\nThe narrator reveals not so much about him or the other characters , but he writes about the essential things we should know through the text .\nThe thief disappears , but the first chapter ending make us feel curious about their next meeting .\nTherefore , I do not know how the story will end .\nToo much mystery and just a few facts can be read in these chapters .\nAll I know is that this story will not have a happy ending .\nProbably , the thief will take Pip to an unwanted adventure that will make him growing up faster .\nI would like to read a story where Pip ends as he starts , at the graveyard .\nLike another brick in the wall , another tombstone in the graveyard .\nI would like to read a story without tale , just a regular man who died while he was learning to live .\nObviously , this would be difficult as the narrator voice clearly comes from a person who lives while he is writing .\nThis is obvious when he makes reference to the fact that photography did not exist when he was a kid .\nConsequently , reading these chapters is a pleasure , but it is difficult to tell what is going to happen or , what is more , what the author is trying to transmit .\nIf the story has a happy ending , then the central theme could be getting over adversities ; if not , it is a sad story .\nAnna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .", "She has been waiting so long for this day to come .\nIt was the day when she was going to meet her biological mother

.\nAfter her 18th birthday , Anna felt a sudden necessity of knowing what happened to her bilogical mother and why did she gave Anna away .\nAfter finding the adoption papers she contacted the

different country .\nIt is based on a survey of the young people from Whitehall College as well as my own opinion as a permanent resident in the area .\nIt seems that the majority of those surveyed are of the opinion that the best place to visit for young people would be Temple Bar .\nIt offers a wide variety of activities like museums , a cinema , a very large green garden and many pubs to choose from .\nThe Johnnie Fox Pub was highly recommended , it offers an opportunity to listen to traditional music , watch dancers perform and enjoy a nice meal in one place .\nThe Odeon cinema offers a multiple choice of movies in 2D and 3D and a discount for students on Wednesdays .\nThe Dublin Wax Museum was suggested by many students .\nSeveral people said that National Botanic Garden is the best place for students to meet and spend time outdoors .\nOn the whole there are activities to take part in and many places to visit depending on students preferences and finances available to them .\nIt is true that people everywhere like watching sports .\nSports starts being admired by youth and can imprint a model of behavior on the young 's minds .\nIn this essay both sides of the position stated above will be analyzed before my own perspective is provided .\nFrom one point of view , top athletes are good models to emulate for several reasons .\nFirstly , watching the success of such athletes , teenagers start to desire to be like their idols and to follow professional sports .\nThis means they will want to play sports , which is essential for their health .\nSecondly , doing sports also teaches priceless life lessons , such as discipline and dealing with success and failure .\nThe importance of working hard to achieve goal\u044b and practicing regularly to become good at something are also demonstrated by professional sportsmen .\nThis is a good example for youngsters to follow .\nFrom another perspective , sometimes professional athletes are not good role models .\nFirstly , sport has become business .\nMany sports stars are only concerned about money and fame .\nThis can lead adolescents to believe that money and fame are an important part of sports instead of learning how to play well and having the fun of the game or the competition .\nSecondly , there are those athletes who behave disgustingly .\nFor example , some take drugs or cheat in order to win at any cost .\nIt goes without saying , that this kind of behavior sends a wrong message to the young .\nIn conclusion , there are a number of advantages and disadvantages in regard to professional sportsmen as good role models for young people .\nOn balance , I am inclined to believe that professional athletes can be excellent role models for the youth , as long as they represent the positive aspects of playing sports .\nDickens and the Bronte sisters use the same style : realistic style .\nThey are influenced by the surrounding in which they live : Dickens the city of London while the Bronte sisters the natural landscape of the Yorkshire .\nDickens and Charlotte Bronte often use the first person narrator or the point of view of the protagonist of the story .\nTheir realism is different : in fact Dickens ' style is that of sentimental realism in which he mixes pathos and comedy , like characters that tend to be caricatures of the vices and virtues he wish to portray , while the Bronte sisters use realistic style laced with Romantic and Gothic elements , like Byronic male heroes and female protagonists that are psychologically complex .\nThe graph illustrates the four different sources of consumption of fish and other meat in European country from 1979 to 2004 .", "Of the given source , the overall fish and meat consumption ranked from nearly 60 grams per person per week to roughly 230 grams per person per week .\nFrom the 4 source ate , 3 of them remained a steady decline with the exception of chicken consumption which had risen over the 25 year period .\nOnly fish consumption showed little change during the period , beginning and ending at approximately the same the level of 52 grams per person per week .\nBoth lamb consumption and the category labelled beef had a decline trend between 1979 and 2004 , although maintained a decrease overall , with lamb consumption falling from a peak of 150 grams per person per week in 1979 down to just over 50 grams per person per week in 2004 and beef consumption falling from around 230 grams per person per week down to just over 120 grams per person per week .\nChicken consumption was the only source of meat consumption which elaborated stable climbing from 150 grams per person per week to the highest consumption 250 per person per week .\nOverall , it is evident from the graph that some sectors declined , others rose and one remained steady consumption over the 25 year span .", "Dear Mr. Merrifield :", "My name is Dmitry Lavrov .\nI 'm a postdoc in Russian Cancer Research Center

There are my CV and a copy of my paper in the attachment .\nI am writing about an important historical place which is my favourite one , I am referring to Lugo city .\nI visited Lugo last summer and I enjoyed myself very much .\nI walked through the old city , through its beautiful squares and parks and I visited its numerous churches , including the cathedral .\nThere are a lot of places in Lugo worth visiting .\nFor example , you can walk around the Roman Wall , which has been declared a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000 because it is the only Roman Wall in the world that is complete .\nI think that Lugo is very beautiful .\nThere are a lot of shops where tourists and visitors can buy souvenirs and there are many restaurants where you can eat delicious and typical dishes , for example , octopus .\nIn Lugo , many traditional parties and festivals take place .\nAmong the most important I can mention San Froil\u00e1n and Arde Lucus .\nFrom 4th to 12th October Lugo holds its San Froil\u00e1n Fiestas .\nSan Froil\u00e1n is a festival of National Tourist Interest .\nThis festival is dedicated to the city 's patron saint , and it shows traditional Galician costumes and folklore .\nAnother important festival in Lugo is Arde Lucus .\nIt is celebrated in June .\nDuring this festivity , Lugo becomes the 3rd century town once again , so you can see Roman circus , Celtic weddings , artisan markets , many musical events taking place and local people and visitors get into period costumes , such as gladiators and Roman Emperors .\nI recommend you visit Lugo in June because Arde Lucus is celebrated .\nYou can enjoy traditional Roman customs and Roman life in Arde Lucus .\nLugo is and incredible city and it is important in the history of my country because it is full of historical places , festivities which show and perform precise periods of the history of Spain , such as the Celtic period and the Roman period .\nThe bigger the city , bigger the problem .", "The town is the 2nd largest urban agglomeration in the country , producing daily large amounts of waste . \"\nCity X \" has no specific waste disposal plan , but a federal law establishes a due term until 1st July .\nDespite it , there are a few plans to increase the green areas and revitalize the town .\nThe city is thriving on implementing new measures to achieve the Council 's goals .\nThe analysis will consist of evaluating the Council 's eco - friendly proposals .\nIn accord with the aforementioned , the amount of garbage produced during the years 2007 and 2010 more than doubled , 86% of it discarded inadequately .\nThis is due to the low effect of the \" Recycling Worms \" program over the disposal problem . \"\nCity X \" incinerates hospital residue , in accordance with legal requirements , and send 7% of the garbage production to recycling factories .\nThe recycling factories have a joint venture with the municipality to sort waste , and show a result 20% better than last year .\nThe program represents 2% of the employment in the city , but it needs to expand .\nThe city has many projects such as the \" Keep it clean , keep it beauty \" , whose goal is to promote proper disposal in the public areas .\nAnother important one is the \" Let 's make it green \" , responsible for increasing the green areas within the city in 150% during the last two years , consisting of a combination of public and private investment in reforestation of rural and communal areas .\nA later crucial activity are the \" Green Communities \" , currently carrying 38% of the total amount of consumed vegetables in the metropolitan area .\nA municipal waste policy that integrates private and public sectors and the community is required to solve the current problem .\nThe city needs a joint venture to support a functional and sustainable commerce of recycled rubbish .\nThe increase of green areas represent a significant improvement in the quality of life according to the USED report of 2012 and also fits in 16 of 20 requirements of a city of the future .\nMost of the \" Recycling Worms \" problem is caused by this lack of training , which can be resolved by training offered in the surrounding universities .\nIt is a good idea to take a year off between leaving school and starting university , because you can have lots of new experiences .\nFor example , you can travel to new places .\nAnother idea is you can work , you can find a job and earn money before you start university .\nMoreover , sometimes people are tired when they finish school because of the exams so they need to have some time to relax .\nYou can travel to different countries if you have time , I would like to go to Asia , Thailand or China .\nBut you need to earn money if you want to travel , so you can first work and then travel .\nYou can find work as a waiter or in a shop .\nHowever , some people think you should go to university immediately after you finish school because if you do n't , you forget what you have learned in school .\nBut I think you can also learn if you travel or if you work so that is a good idea also , especially if you find a job related with what you want to study .\nWe live in a time when everything changes quickly .\nA technological development make people believe that in the future everything will look like in science - fiction movies .\nWe 'll be surrounded by machines and robots .\nWe 'll have a possibility to choose on which planet we want to live .\nAnd what about houses ?\nWill people 's homes be different or still the same ?\nImagining the future , I see everything different .\nThe avant - garde and futuristic projects of houses will be the most desirable .\nThe houses will have , for example , the shape of a sphere or igloo .\nSome of them might be turned upside down .\nSometimes they will be some kind of a modern art and it will be hard to describe a shape .\nAnd what about interiors ?\nIn our service there will be more machines and robots with an artificial intelligence .\nThey will practically do everything : clean , cook , remind us what we have to do and also speak with us like an average human .\nIn practice there will be no normal furniture , just machines waiting for a command .\nEverything will be artificial and uncozy .\nThat 's how I see a home of the future .\nGlad to hear that you 've been invited to attend the last round of interview next month !\nI really hope to work with you someday !\nTo make sure you get the position successfully , here are some useful advice and information you might want to know .\nAt the interview , leaving interviewers a good impression is of great importance . Here're some tips on how to do it .\nFirst , dressing as properly as possible .\nBusinesslike suits and ties fit in well with the formal occasion .\nSuitable dressing comes across as effective and reliable .\nSecond , being punctual .\nInterviewers have to cope with tight schedule everyday so they are n't willing to spare one more minute to wait for a candidate who 's late somehow .\nThird , being prepared .\nAs the old saying goes , well prepared is half done .\nYou 're expected to know something about our company , ask proper questions and communicate effectively with interviewers .\nIf you can learn as much knowledge about our company as you can up front , you really stand a chance in the interview .\nSince you 've applied for the sales assistant in the sales department , the sales manager will be interviewing you .\nHe started out his career as an accountant , but he was fed up with dealing with numbers all day long .\nPlus , he 's willing to communicate with others and take on new challenges so he transferred to the sales department two years ago .\nHe got promoted very quickly because he always brought forth new ideas and facilitated the reform and development in the department .\nIn his eyes , what counts most is the track record and the capabilities shown in the previous working experiences , so he might ask you some questions like what you achieved and how you felt about your last job .\nI hope what I mention above will be of some help to you .", "Looking forward to hearing from you soon .\nLots of Love ,\nIris", "Dear Sir or Madam\nI write in connection with your advertisement regarding jobs at summer camps all over the USA .\nSince my mother tongue is English , albeit of the British variety , and I am generally deemed cheerful , energetic and hard working , I believe I am a suitable candidate for the aforementioned position .\nAdditionally , as a teenager , I supervised a Wolf Cub pack of eight to twelve - year - olds , and often organised sports and evening activities for them , such as treasure hunts and paper chases .\nMoreover , when an undergraduate , I spent my summers working in the college canteen as a kitchen help , and progressed to the position of cook .\nBecause of all the above points , I think I am a suitable person for the job .", "Yours faithfully\nI find it quite difficult to find an area of improvement given Andres 's outstanding overall performance .\nYet , oftentimes , being overly respectful may play against him and although he has gained the respect of all the people he has worked with , some of them suggested he should build up his self - confidence , rather than end up attempting to cover everyone 's back and taking ownership for other people 's mistakes .\nIf I had my own language school I would first bear in mind a main goal : raising public awareness of my language school and the services it will provide .\nThen I would start gathering some information about the market , that is to say , social trends , population statistics such as age , gender and family type , potential customers and competitors as well .\nBy doing so , I would be able not only to identify the strengths and weaknesses of my product and to improve my performance but also to identify customers ' needs .\nAfter that , I would make a list of target markets and device some strategies to attract them .\nFor instance , if my goal was to increase young people 's awareness , some strategies could be to increase online social media presence by posting regular updates about my language school on Twitter and Facebook or to offer discounts for sibblings .\nInstead , if my goal was to increase adult 's awarenes , advertising in local newspapers or offering intensive courses could prove successful .\nHowever , if the target markets were both , young people and adults , offering discounts for family groups could be a better choice .\nThe last step would be to recruit a staff of prfesional , experienced and qualified teachers and to set an attractive and reasonable price for the services I would provide .\nLast but not least , I would test ideas and approaches on customers and staff to make sure that my marketing plan succeeded .\nAnd you ?\nHave you ever thought about how you can promote your language courses for example ?\nI challenge you to think about it and try it .\nAccording to recent research , there are no doubts that natural gas drilling rigs , natural gas pipelines and underground gas storage contribute to increasing wealth of the local communities .\nPeople who live in the areas of natural gas infrastructure earn from a few to several percent more than those who live in other regions where such an infrastructure does n't exist .\nAnother advantage is that developing natural gas industry equals new jobs what is profitable for people living in whereabouts .\nExploration and extraction of the shale gas will create lots of new jobs in very different branches connected with gas industry for instance in exploration , mining , production and distribution of shale gas .\nWe can not ignore the fact that companies which cooperate with this infrastructure will also create vacancy jobs .\nEven if companies will hire engineers and specialists mostly from abroad , there will be upgrowth in a number of job positions in gastronomy and hospitality zones as they need to eat and sleep somewhere .\nAccording to the dynamics of development of the natural gas infrastructure , there will be constant development in gastronomy and hospitality sectors as well .\nThe Kosciuszko Institute conducted a research which shows that Poland can benefit from extracting and developing the infrastructure of shale gas\nGreece is an amazing country that a lot of people visit annually .", "When planning their vacation a lot of tourists are faced with the dilemma of which places to visit .\nChoosing where to go in Greece can be hard as there are so many choices .\nThere are some travel destinations that definitely stand out , such as Santorini .\nSandy beaches , crystal clear waters and the friendly locals are not the only things that set it apart from other islands .\nSantorini also has a volcano which is a spectacular sight , even though exploring it can be dangerous !\nAnother place worth visiting in Greece is Athens .\nBelieve it or not , Athens is one of the most beautiful cities in the world .\nThe Parthenon , the Acropolis Museum and the district of Monastiraki are just a few of the things that people love about Athens .\nLast but not least , Crete is one of the most spectacular islands in Greece .\nOther than having beautiful sandy beaches and being the largest island in Greece , people can visit the water sports parks there , which are extremely fun !\nSumming up , Greece is a beautiful country worth visiting , although choosing where to go can be hard .\nThe question is whether it 's better to prepare for a long time before the exam or few days are going to be enough .\nIn my personal experience , I believe that it 's much better to prepare for a long time before any exam you may face in your life .\nIt 's quite important to be organized to get the highest score you can get in your exam .\nFor example , one year ago , I had my final surgery exam .\nI had set up a plan to study all the books we had to go through for the exam plus reviewing them twice .\nThe plan required my commitment for around a 12 hours daily study for almost 3 months .\nFor the hard work and perfect discipline , I was able to get a very high score in my Surgery finals .\nIf I had n't had such an organized plan , I would never have got such a perfect score .\nAnother thing to add is not being stressed before the exam night .\nIt 's quite normal to have this basic feeling of being stressed and nervous when exams are approaching .\nWhat is not normal at all is having anxiety due to the plethora of studies you haven't finished and are included in your exam .\nFor example , I once had a chemistry exam in high school and I was ignorant enough to neglect my studies thinking that I still had enough time to ace my exam .\nTwo days before my exam , I realized that I ran out of time .\nI had insomnia the night of my exam , it was n't enough that I was n't well prepared but also my nerves got torn out and that affected my scores tremendously .\nEver since I do everything in its due time in order not to be overly stressed and get low scores .\nMoreover , if I aim at getting high scores , I assert that memorizing the details is important .\nIf you do n't start studying before exam with an appropriate time , you will only have enough time to know the broad lines of the subject , but this will never help you soak the details and understand the concepts lying behind every single word .\nThat will help you a lot even if you do n't get the chance to revise everything before your exam .\nI can recall that time when I was quite ill before my Anatomy exam ; I could only go through the main titles of each branch without going through the details .\nIn the exam , I had that question where it required describing a concept ; amazingly , I was able to do it perfectly .\nSince I had practiced a lot and memorized that concept before many times , I was able to remember it .\nIt was just flooding without so much effort .\nSo , for sure having enough time to memorize and practice what you learn is going to help you a lot in your exam .\nIn sum , I believe that setting a schedule to have a long time preparation plan is much better than having only few days to get prepared . If you want to get high scores and perform greatly , you should start studying from day one if possible .\nDo n't you think you are worth getting the highest score one could aim at ?\nIn my opinion , nuclear energy has the best chance to replace fossil fuels .\nFirstly , nuclear energy is n't bad for the environment .\nThe Carbon dioxide emissions is very small .\nThe biggest threat is the explosion .\nHowever , the technology is evolving and nuclear power plants are getting safer .\nSecondly , nuclear power plants are already very popular and this type of energy is the closest to replace fossil fuels .\nEnergy which we get from sun and wind is still are only a few percent of world energy production .\nThirdly , only the construction of a nuclear power plant is expensive .\nWhen we have a plant , making energy from that is very cheap .\nThe most expensive thing in nuclear plant is to hire qualified personnel .\nBesides , we need something that can work all the time .\nIt ca n't stop making energy when the weather is bad , because people need a lot of electricity .\nIf we run out of power entire cities could plunge the chaos , and this is unacceptable .\nLima is the only South American city which is a capital and it is located overlooking the Pacific Ocean .\nLima was founded by Francisco Pizarro in 1535 , as \" Ciudad de los Reyes \" .\nLima has a multicultural tradition , then in it coincide a complex mix of racial and ethnic groups like mestizos , European Peruvians which are the second largest group and the minority in Lima includes Aymara and Quechua and Afro - Peruvians .\nLima is the best example of colonization , immigration , and indigenous influences such as the stay of Pre - Hispanic legacy with architectural monuments , called \" Huacas \" .\nThe Historic Centre of Lima was declared World Heritage Site in 1988 .\nIt is a city that keeps its history through an amazing architecture like balconies , churches like San Francisco Church which has mysterious subterranean catacombs ; el Real Felipe which is the last incredible Spanish fortress ; through their costumes as well as Carnival , this day you can enjoy this particular , interesting and colorful festival because you use water , paint or talc to wet your family and neighbor ; their typical dance called \" La Marinera \" ; also they keep their history through religion where you discover the religious enthusiasm which is represented by la Procesi\u00f3n del Se\u00f1or de los Milagros ; their gastronomy is another extraordinary and wonderful example about their symbols , like Mazamorra Morada , el Pisco Sour ( wine ) , el Ceviche , los Picarones , etc .\nLima is a beautiful city of contrast , where you can find a diversity of historical , modern and business places .\nArchaeological sites , beaches , valleys , natural reserves and the exquisite cuisine give Peru 's capital an authentic personality and sightseeing in Lima is a unique and fantastic experience .\nDefinitely , Lima is a spectacular and charming city to spend your perfect holidays .\nHi Jane ,\nLast time you asked me for some information about opening a saving account in the UK . I 've done some research to find out the best savings account for you .\nBelow you can find a few suggestions of mine .\nThe Phone Bank might give quite a good offer for you .\nFirstly , the rate of interest is by 3.1% , which is quite good .\nAdditionally , if you open a saving account in that bank , you will get a diary as a gift .\nAnd you do not need to pay any annual charges for having a credit card .\nUnfortunately , the bank does n't have branches in Britain .\nAnd all banking operations must be done by phone .\nThe second bank , Royal Savings Bank , has many branches in the UK ( over 650 ) , so you can make all bank operations on spot .\nBut there is a service charge for owning a credit card ( \u00a3 12 per year ) .\nYou do also get a gift as a new account holder , a full set of saucepans ( do you really need it ? ) .\nAll in all , I would recommend you to open your first serving account in the Phone Bank , since the rate of interest is higher and you do n't need to pay any annual charges .\nAnd doing operations by phone are actually very easy and they always give you a great opportunity to improve your English .", "The final decision is yours .", "Take care and see you very soon ,\nYours Agnieszka\nTo : gKL6@yahoo.com\nFrom : oS7jM@yahoo.com\nSubject : An important thing to do !\nMy dear Paul ,\nI 'm writing to tell you how happy I am that I had the opportunity to be the chosen person to deal with the sound recording at Lady Gaga 's concert .\nIt must have been my friend , Marius Boni , who recommended me for this service .\nI could n't believe my ears when the phone rang and I answered and they said they wanted me to get at the concert as soon as possible to see how good I was in sound recording .\nWhat can I say ?\nIt 's been my dream since childhood and now I was overwhelmed when I realised they thought at me to do this for such a great , important person in the world music industry .\nI am glad that they were satisfied with my service .\nI can hardly wait for you to see you and to share with my happiness and to tell you all the details of this unique experience ! ! !\nYours ,", "Ionut\nI have been skiing for most of life and I am very enthusiastic about it .\nI started when I was six with equipment that was very basic compared to what skiers use these days .\nEvery day as soon as I woke up I looked forward to my morning on the slopes .\nMy parents would take me to a gentle slope with my brother and leave us there for a couple of hours to try skiing on our own .\nThe temperature was often several degrees below zero , and you would freeze if you did n't keep moving up and down the slope .\nMy brother showed a natural talent for the sport , but I felt quite uncomfortable and scared .\nLittle by little I improved my skiing skills and by the time I was a teenager I really started enjoying myself .\nNowadays I have a lot of fun skiing because it gives me the opportunity to be in a wonderful natural environment .\nSkiing is a great sport , but I would recommend starting as a child , taking a few lessons with an experienced instructor and using the right equipment .\nAfter six years of rigorous high school subjects and past experiences , I have no doubt that the preferences I 've selected above are not accidental .", "I am extremely interested in gaining experience in the business field .\nThe subjects I 've pursued at my high school level such as financial accounting , commerce and economics has given me the opportunity to utilize and put into perspective the knowledge of understanding business concepts and has given me a solid academic foundation .\nI 've also participated in various group works and class projects while in high school .\nI am planning to gain admission into the university of my choice in order to obtain a bachelor 's degree .\nI would love to associate with extremely talented students , lecturers and even professors in order to receive a well rounded introduction to the numerous aspects of any of the preferences I 've selected above .\nAcademically , I 've always been a very determined and studious individual and I would be more than willing to devote myself to the hardwork necessary in order to achieve a bachelor 's degree .\nI also have an indubitable passion for extra - curricular activities .\nI was the president of the Business Students Association ( BSA ) , Head Boy ( senior prefect boy ) and Captain of the soccer school team .\nI am a very good soccer player who plays a midfield role .\nUndertaking a scholarship and admission into one of the universities I have selected above will provide me with the opprtunity to apply the knowledge gained at high school into a business setting , as well as develop the communication , organisation and numeracy skills I have acquired at high school .\nAfter I heard about the Czech Government Scholarship , I decided to make some research on Czech Republic before taking any step in applying .\nI found out that Czech Republic is a country with rich possibilities for students planning to study abroad and is currently undergoing rapid social changes and transformation , making it a fascinating place for students of any discipline to study in .\nCzech universities provides high standards of education , internationally recognized degrees , modern campuses with outstanding facilities , safe and affordable education warm and friendly environment and cultural diversity .\nI believe that I will have the opportunity to experience both modernity and tradition in one if the safest and most stable countries in Europe .\nAbove all , the high quality if education will make me ready for the future .\nAnother major reason why I am being motivated to study in Czech Republic is lack of finance .\nAlso , education in Nigeria is now a joke as teachers and lecturers go on strike frequently , and learning in some parts of Nigeria are not safe !\nRight now , I am greatly looking forward to the challenges of a university life academically , socially and mentally , and I believe that my ambition to learn new business concepts coupled with my passion for extra - curricular activities and community service , would make me a competent addition to the any of my proposed university and the Czech Republic Scholarship team .\nI believe that I can make a positive contribution to my proposed university , as I will be actively involved in student events and activities that will help to promote a healthy learning environment for all .\nIn conclusion , I can assure you that I will be a capable and dedicated student who has the committment and dedication to work hard in order to be a graduate , whilst at the same time , contributing greatly to my proposed university in more ways than one .\nA dog is man 's best friend\nIt is a well - known fact that people need to have communication with other people .\nHowever , they are not always satisfied or taken into the society .\nThey seek solace in someone who they would feel more comfortable with .\nThe best example is an animal with great qualities , a dog .\nDog 's personality is one of their best qualities .\nAlways friendly , bubbly and in a good mood , they are great to spend time with .\nThey feel when their master is sad and react by cuddling up to them .\nIt makes people forget all about their problems and concentrate on the things that really matter .\nDog 's optimism is by far the best way to bring back a smile on people 's face .\nAnd that is what they are there for , to make people happy .\nThese hairy four - legged animals are also very protective .\nOne of their jobs is to watch out their human family .\nSo if they sense that their owner might be in danger , they immediately react by barking at a person or a thing thing that might have caused it .\nThe stronger the bond between the dog and their owner , the stronger the dog 's reaction will be .\nIt is believed that dogs require a lot of attention , which is not true .\nDogs are really not that hard to take care of , bathing and grooming do n't need to be done every day , they just need to be fed and walked regularly .\nThese pets need a few walks a day , which could also be good for their owners who are spending all day at work or in school and need some physical activity .\nSo having a dog could also remind them to live a healthier life .\nIn conclusion , dogs make really great pets .\nNot only do they protect you from anything that could do you any harm , but their amazing personality and the love they show to you makes you feel so warm and wonderful on the inside .\nSo if someone really loves their pet , they would find time to pay lot of attention to them , because , they truly are man 's best friend .\nHi John !\nIt 's great to hear from you again ! I will give you some details about my experience at \" Zoe Kak adventure \" , one of the most well - known centres in our country .\nFirst of all , we started with a tiring assault course , which consisted of climbing up pretty sharp walls and crawling through different obstacles .\nAlthough it made me feel exhausted , I found it extremely entertaining .\nLuckily , I was fit enough to finish the exercise without having any problem , however , you may need to train a little bit more before embarking on this activity .\nRock climbing was another of the challenges I had to face .\nDespite the fact that it turned out to be harder than I had expected , I managed to reach the summit .\nYou ca n't imagine how rewarding is the feeling of being on the top of the mountain , after such a big effort!.\nFurthermore , you will be able to practise canoeing . You are likely to feel scared at first , but your confidence will be built up quickly , due to the constant support of your teachers .\nOne of the last activities offered by the centre was diving .\nI felt so overwhelmed that I had to give it up , so if you do n't want to miss out this great opportunity too , trust your trainers , since they are highly qualified .\nTo sum up , I strongly believe that you will have a great time there and I guarantee you that all the teachers meet with the safety rules , so you will enjoy a lot without getting yourself into trouble .\nFor all these reasons , this centre 's really worth a visit\nWrite soon and let me know if you need to know anything else .", "With best wishes :", "Sara .\nI felt so excited when I looked at the envelope on the desk of my

parents disappointed with educational systems and institutionalized education try to spot in homeschooling a solution for their children 's education .\nAlthough homeschooling may seem , according to some of these parents ' opinions , \" a paved road \" , it\nis a path not suitable for everybody 's cars and that compels us to seek other routes .\nHomeschooling should not be considered a wold - wide phenomenon since only a few countries : the UK ,", "Canada , and especially the USA , can boast .", "There are lots of countries that do not", "accept homeschooling as a legal alternative so far and others where it is just an isolated happening .\nThe situation in Spain can be assessed as \" legal vacuum \" in light of our constitutional right to free\neducation meanwhile attendance is compulsory in elementary and secondary education .\nEducational and emotional freedom support this alternative way of learning .\nHomeschooling may also free up time for complementary activities such as music , sports , and even the family life .\nHomeschooled students ' success has been backed up by the results on standardize test and the recognition of prestigious universities .\nNow though , before homeschooling your kids you also have to consider the same amount of roadblocks :\nthe lack of facilities or expertise , not enough socialization for your children , ending up being a frustrated parent without enough money to make ends meet .\nAs far as I am concerned I want to think about homeschooling as a wake up call for educational\nsystems .", "However , homeschooling will never succeed if parents do not have the right skills .", "As traditional education seems to be exhausted , new technologies open up as \" the\nsolution \" and blended learning is the future .\nGeographic and natural environment around the building space , as well as the neighbourhood , would be surely taken into consideration while designing houses of the future .\nObviously , the future also indicates a home with more technology and very energy efficient systems .\nIn areas exposed to cataclysms , such as earthquakes , hurricanes and floods , people should have their houses built of resistant materials .\nSteel or concrete structures would give the desired effect in this particular matter .\nEnvironmentally friendly buildings will be definitely on the drawing board .\nBuilt with recyclable or recycled materials , the exterior surface of these houses should be ready to be lit by daylight on sunny days , not to mention skylights and solar panels on the roofs , which is more and more popular even these days .\nMoreover , solar energy collectors ought to be controlled by computers in order to maximise comfort and energy efficiency .\nUrban housing issues ( such as population growth ) will be solved by exploiting some new areas .\nMaybe it 's building castles in the air , but houseboats and apartments situated above city streets seem to be a perfect solution to use up space that would otherwise be wasted .\nAlthough people would keep mulling over how to modernize their fancy houses ( and bragging about it to neighbours ) , they will still need a warm , cosy bed and a nice cup of tea .\nI suppose that will never change , even if they live in a concrete ivory tower .", "Catch it or lose it\nThe alpha and the omega of a good team is trust .\nThat 's the most important point if you want to play handball .\nYou must be able to throw the ball blindly to your teammate and he has to catch it .\nOtherwise the opponent will have the chance to get a point .\nAre you a real team player ?\nHandball is one of the most dynamic sports in this world .\nOver eighty points can be made all together in sixty minutes , if not even more .\nThis shows how rapidly the game can change .\nOne lost ball can make your team the loser of the game .\nI started to play handball when I was 5 years old .\nAt first , it was only a hobby but with the years it became passion .\nWhat I love most about this sport is , the speed and the unconditional team spirit .\nIf you want to practise handball , just be sure that you have a good team and do n't forget the fun !\nTriathlon : A famous sport throughout the world\nIt seems as if , recently , society has become more conscious of the importance of practising a sport .\nClearly , this is a consequence of the extra hours we have to work per day and as a way of relaxing , we find doing a sport as an effective way of taking the stress of our bodies .\nIn fact , we can see many people jogging and cycling these days whether it is in the morning before going to work or even after .\nDespite these two being the most popular sports amongst atlets , many more are just as interesting and profitable .\nOne of them is triathlon , which is my favourite sport .\nIt consists of a mixture between three different sports , swimming , cycling and jogging and as a result it can be extremely demanding .\nWhat I enjoy most about it is being able to practise it anywhere , which means I can do it near home instead of having to go to a sports center .\nIt also means I can choose the location that most pleases me and therefore fully enjoy the time spent doing it .\nTriathlon has become more popular over the past few years and more and more people are eager to try it .\nTherefore , it is crucial to understand that improving in such a demanding sport requires time and is is important to establish some goals in order to keep motivated .\nYou must not push yourself too far .\nA gap year between school and college sounds a great idea for those that have not decided what they want to study .\nHowever there are some questions whether it should be everyone or not .\nFirst , I would like to put the arguments in favour of the year off .\nNot everybody has the financial possibilities to pay for college , so taking a gap year to earn money to help with the bills it is time well spend .\nBut that it is not the only reason to take a year off .\nMost of the people think that this year is to travel to other countries and spend all your time at parties , but this is not true , you can travel to develop your culture and do volunteer work , so you can become a better person .\nOn the other hand , many teens who take a year off end up to spend it in the wrong way .\nFor example , things might gone not as they had expected for multiple reasons such as not having enoff money or not getting a job .\nIn conclusion , people should take a year off , but only when they have all planed and know for shore that they have the

Tolkien .\nSet in England in the first centuries of the Middle Ages , the story is about the adventures of Giles , a farmer of the village of Ham who becomes a hero against his wishes by defeating a giant .\nWhen the dragon Chrysophylax comes and devastates everything , he is sent twice against him , not only managing to defeat him thanks to the magic sword Tailbiter , but also obtaining a huge treasure .\nAt the end of the story , Giles becomes an independent king .\nI liked a lot this story firstly because I love fantasy stories , especially Tolkien 's ones : they bring me to another universe , making me forget every day 's life .\nSecondly it is very original because it is a sort of parody of traditional legends : the hero is an ordinary person , knights reveal fearful and incompetent and clashes are won with words instead of weapons .\nI would recommend this story to everybody because it is funny and adventurous and Tolkien 's ironic style , based also on the comical use of Latin words , makes it extremely pleasant to read .\nDear Sir or Madam ,", "I am writing this letter to apply for the position in USA Summer Camp that I saw advertised in our local newspaper .\nI am interested in working in the Educational Institutions , or in the Social Care .\nI have recently graduated from the Social Science University in Psychology and received high degrees in both my Teaching and Supervising Courses .\nIn addition we had to have one year of volunteering in Youth Supervising environment in preparation for our finished assingment , so I am able to be a member of your well skilled staff .\nSince I was 13 years old , I have helped my parents with upbringing my four junger siblings .\nI have been involved in volunteering in a variety of youth organizations as supervisor and tutor .\nIn the past two years I have worked in the Scout Organization , helping area manager to organize activities for children .\nThis experience has given me the ability to cope with the needs of all types of children 's personalities .\nI have a friendly , happy personality and find that I enjoy the chalenges of working in youth environments .\nIn addition , my studies and experience I have taught me to be accurate and efficient in organizing my work , so I would be a valuable addition to your team .\nI look forward to hearing from you .", "Yours faithfully", "Lubomir Sawicki\nDoes traveling broaden your mind ?\nIn my opinion , travelling does broaden your mind .\nWhen visit different places , you get to see different environments , cultures , people and even different languages .\nTravelling helps you to develop as a person in many ways .\nFor example , if you learn another language different from your own one , even if it is just a few basic sentences , you can communicate with people from different regions and you improve your confidence .\nTravelling also helps to see the way in which other people live , to see that your way of living is not the only one that exists .\nThis can help you to understand that not everyone has acces to many things you do have acces too , and to realise that perhaps you should appreciate these things , such as smartphones , computers , cars or even fresh water , which is a basic resource and we tend to take for granted that everyone can have some water to drink even though this is not true .\nBesides , when we travel to different places we see there are many different cultures that differ greatly from our own culture , and we see how different from one another humans are .\nFor all of these reasons I think travelling really broadens your mind .\nI want to build my career as a fully fledged researcher and academician .\nTo fulfill this dream a PhD degree would be the most essential footstep .\nI am mostly also interested to pursue my PhD on Theoretical and Computational Chemistry .\nI have a plan to study of the equilibrium properties of condensed - phase systems .\nI would also like to carry out my PhD research in the development of transition metal complexes which can be used as drugs against several human diseases , as cosmetics materials and as photonic and optoelectronic materials in devices .\nI also find Analytical Chemistry and Environmental Chemistry are the interesting fields of Chemistry because of their numerous applications .\nI believe that I possess the strong motivation and intellectual capability to build a career in one of the previously mentioned fields .\nAfter my PhD , I will return to my country and continue my teaching as well as research with students of University of Barisal .\nThere is no future for public transport ?\nThe number of cars grow up rapidly , however the public transport is still in use .\nEspecially in a big cities , where there are traffic jams , the public transport is becoming more and more popular again .\nIn some cities it 's even forbidden to drive through the city center without some special permission , so there is no other solution than use a public transport .\nBut what is more convenient - own car or public transport ?\nWell it depends .... When you travel with your own car you are independent .\nYou do not have to worry about the schedule - you are a driver so it 's your decision whenever you want to go or stay longer in some place .\nYou can listen to your favorite music or radio .\nYou are the boss .\nHowever , as a driver you always have to be careful and watch out on the route .\nIf you want to travel from one place to another to see different places , your own car is the best solution .\nIt allows you to see much more in your pace .\nBut think about the costs .\nThink how much you pay for a petrol nowadays .\nConsider as well how many days do you have for vacations .\nMaybe cheap airlines are better ?\nBeing back to our everyday life .\nMost of us are living in a big cities and face problems with the traffic .\nWhat if we use the public transport to get to work ?\nWell , then you do n't have to worry about the parking space and you can read more books on the way to work .\nSimply , you can use the way to work as an additional time for yourself .", "What else ?\nAfter work you can go for a drink with your colleagues !\nAnd if the ecology is important for you just think about the pollution .\nLet 's reflect one again : is there a future for public transport ?\nIn my opinion : yes , there is !\nIs travelling by car more convenient ?\nWell , it depends !", "Why using the first narration ?\nThe first narration can attract readers ' attention at the beginning of the friction and makes the readers get into the thoughts of the madman easily .\nWe ca n't understand what others think usually , but in this friction , the author invited us know what inside the madman 's mind .\nFeeling that the main character is talking to us , as if we were all involved in this case , the whole thing seemed like really happened .\nFacing the murder directly makes the horror penetrates into our hearts .\nHow does the author create a word of horror to his readers ?\nThe author created the horrible atmosphere by describing the scene , the disordered mind and the sound of heartbeats .\nFirst , the scene that described the murder makes readers ca n't help themselves emerging the images in their mind .\nJust like the madman 's plan was happening right in front us .\nThen comes to the sound , the heartbeats .\nTo my opinion , heartbeat is the element that push the whole story to the climax .\nEvery time when the sound of heartbeats started arousing , something ensued .\nIn the first time , when the madman heard the heartbeats of the old man , he was going to kill the old man , and he did it .\nThe second time when madman heard the heartbeats , he became impatient , scared , excited and insane , in the end , he confessed that he killed the man and dismembered the corpse .\nAt the same time , the heartbeats also dragged the readers nervous and anxious .\nFinally , I think the way the author wanted to express the disordered mind of the madman is his intonation .\nThe whole story except the end of the friction he confessed the crime , the madman 's used the intonation that is extremely calm and steady , to tell the readers the process of the cruel thing that he had done .\nThe sharp contract for the calm and the cruelty , leaves us a strong impression that the main character was totally insane and crazy .\nShivering inside our hearts , the horror increases .\n\" Let 's go to the forest to see the variety of animals which are found there \" , Max told to his friends one sunny afternoon .\nWhen all was set , they started their trip to the forest .\nWhen they arrived there , they started to look around trying to find different types of animals such as birds , rabbits and deer .\nMax and his friends took a walk under the trees when , acroos the river , they saw something that looked like an animal lying on the grass.\"What 's that ? \" , Max said aloud .\nThey ran quickly , crossed the river and they reached the place where the animal was.\"It 's a deer ! , its leg is in a trap \" , Max 's friend shouted .\nWhen they saw the animal , they could see that it was suffering , so they decided to free the deer .\nBy this decision , Max took courage to open the trap , but the deer did n't move because its leg was injured .\nOne of Max 's friend brought water from the river to give to the deer .\nMax cut a piece of his T - shirt to cure the animal .\nAfterwards , the animal was better and it walked away slowly .\nWhen the day finished , Max and his friends returned home feeling happy because they had saved the animal 's life.\"What an amazing day ! \" , Max whispered to himself as he got into bed that night .\nThe question is : whether it is possible to be famous without journalists ?\nProbably not , but they are many people in show - busines or political life , who are ready to do everything to save their private life .\nGenerally , people may be famous for two reasons : because of their job or because of their scandalising private life .\nIf you decide to became famous because of your scandalising private life , it would be silly to complain about tiring paparazzi .\nThere is a rule , probably one of the most important in public life , that says more or less : ' It is not important what are they talking about you , it is important they are talking about you ' .\nMost of celebrities follow this rule , as it is just what they are living for .\nThat is why they are often able to sell information about their private life .\nReal problem starts when journalists injures not the celebrity , but its friends or family .\nPaparazzi are cruel in contact with famous people 's children , that may have negative influence on their emotional development .\nHow about those who do not want to be popular because of scandals ?\nIn most cases they are just doing their job as well as they can , leading their boring life .\nAnd when finally paparazzi notice that there is nothing interesting in their life , they just leave them alone .\nSummarizing , I do believe that adult people are responsible enough to make a decision , if they want to share the most important part of their life with journalists .\nAnd I hope they understand , their duty is to save their relatives .\nGreat food is probably one of the most valuable pleasures of life .\nAs a person who loves to eat , I consider environment , quality of food and price as the main factors to decide where should I go .\nLast Friday I visited a brand new Mexican restaurant in Lisbon called \" Las Ficheras \" .\nIt was suggested by two friends of mine and according to them , because the good food and funny environment .\nI went to dinner with more 6 friends in order to having fun and eat good Mexican food after a stressful week .\nIn my opinion , the food was good but the prices were too expensive considering the quantity served and the messy service .\nWe faced continuous problems with the order such as : dishes from another table served for us by mistake , the drinks were served with a considerable delay and the bill was shown even without asking ( just because we finished the dinner but our drinks were still on the table ) .\nFor my luck ( or not ) , I met a friend of mine on the day after that told me that she had dinner at \" Las Ficheras \" before and in her opinion , as a Mexican , that restaurant was terrible .\nShe also told me that a great Mexican restaurant was just opened with lower prices and good service .\nI got curious about this place and decided to go later .\n\" Pistola y Coraz\u00f3n Taqueria \" was the first Mexican restaurant that I could eat genuine Mexican food , with lower prices and a great service .\nThey served us \" nachos \" with tomato sauce for free while we were choosing the main dishes .\nAfter choosing , a bottle of fresh water was served , again , for free .\nWe chose \" tacos \" of meat with guacamole sauce and it was absolutely delicious .\nAfter paying the bill , they offered us a shot of tequila to finish our visit confirming that great places still exists .\nHey !

This opinion is also represented by the British Secretary of energy and climate change , Amber Rudd , who considers the climate change to be one of the greatest problems in nowadays ' politics due to its consequences on economy , global security and the fight against poverty .\nShe stands up for a global deal confirmed on the UN summit by the leading states and therefore these climate targets should be a role - model for other countries .\nFurthermore , climate scientist Ed Hawkins expects a continuation of global warming , clarifying this statement with the example of Central England , which has warmed 20% more than the global average .\nGlobal warming in general leads to more natural disasters as flooding , heatwaves , water stress and loss of harvests .\nFacing these consequences , a 4C warming would be even more damaging according to Belcher .\nDespite the result of a NASA study pointing out that there would have been an ice mass grew in Antarctica from 2003 - 2008 , there is only a small chance of 5 - 10% that this prognosis will come true according to Prof Andrew Shepherd , University of Leeds , as the study has already been proven wrong by 57 other studies .\nAlthough the NASA study shows a different result , the majority of scientists see global warming as a dangerous threat for this planet in terms of living conditions , environment and economy and as well as an issue of the UN summit in Paris .\nThe problem lies in the outdated framework in which the IWC operates .\nFifteen whaling nations formed the IWC after whale populations collapsed .\nThe organisation was initially set up to conserve whales only to the extent that they could continue to be used by humans .\nThe importance of World Heritage properties transcends national boundaries .\nTheir qualities are extraordinary so that no matter which country they are found in , and who experiences them , they evoke a sense of wonder and admiration .\nTo be included on the World Heritage List , properties must be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one of ten selection criteria .\nThe World heritage list is important because it attracts tourists and these landmarks are cherished by everyone around the world .\nIt is also protected by UNESCO because they have found new animals or plants ; there are endangered spices in that area or have a significant importance in history .\nWorld Heritage is the designation for places on Earth that are of outstanding universal value to humanity and as such , have been inscribed on the World Heritage List to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy .\nThe site is the property of the country on whose territory it is located , but it is considered in the interest of the international community to protect the site for future generations .\nIts protection and preservation becomes a concern of the international World Heritage community as a whole .\nAnother advantage for a site to be inscribed on the List is that once a country signs the Convention , and has sites inscribed on the World Heritage List ; the resulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preservation .\nGreater awareness leads to a general rise in the level of the protection and conservation given to heritage properties .\nA country may also receive financial assistance and expert advice from the World Heritage Committee to support activities for the preservation of its sites .\nThe Disadvantages of sites not included in the World Heritage List are that these sites are not funded so they ca n't protect them for risks .\nMoreover they remind in the list of sites in danger without to receive assistance .\nIn my opinion the sites in danger unless they not answer at ten criteria should be protect for UNESCO .\nIt 's difficult , but I think that it is necessary try to invent new way to finance and defend the natural and cultural heritage .\nCricket is my passion .\nI love playing , watching and talking about it .\nIt 's my first passion and I am following it as far as my earliest memory goes .\nCricket is a team sport which teaches us team work , collaboration and strict discipline .\nIt also teaches us how to overcome individual weaknesses and gain advantage of others strength to succeed as a team .\nI started playing cricket since my early childhood .\nEven when I was a kid I started playing with boys of much higher age than me .\nIt gave me a lot of confidence and a chance to improve my skills rapidly .\nI followed cricket religiously and have watched almost every match India played .\nSachin Tendulkar is my favorite cricketer .\nI am fan of his batting .\nHe has broken almost every record in cricket history .\nApart from his cricketing skills I loved his ability to handle pressure and his calm nature in all situations .\nIf someone wants to learn more about cricket I will advise him to watch batting of great like Sachin , Dravid , Lara and Pointing .\nTo learn more about bowling one should watch Akram , Warne and Murli .\nI will also advise reading more about cricket on cricinfo.com .\nIt has nice articles , reviews and statistics on many players and games .\nReading biographies of some famous cricketers will also help to understand the insights of the game in deep .\nCricket is going through rough phase due to match fixing and betting scandals .\nBut I am sure it will come strong out of this and will spread its wings all across the world and once again give its lovers a magnificent show .\nI met a friend about one week ago , and he asked me a question that I ca n't stop thinking about : What is on my Bucket List ?\nI ca n't stop thinking about it , because I realized that I had never stopped to think about my life in such a deep way .\nBy the way , do you know what a Bucket List is ?\nIt is a list of things that you want to do before you die .\nI think is kind of sad , that I do n't know what I want to do , I do n't know what makes me truly happy .\nAbout two weeks before I met him I watched a very beautiful movie called \" The fault in our stars \" .\nIt 's about a teen couple who are diyng because of cancer , and they have different ways to think about life and death .\nThis movie has touched me very deeply , it made me think about life and about the way people used to live without apprecciate the really important things .\nSo after watching this movie and my friend 's question I ca n't help thinking about my life .\nNow I have the feeling that I need to live more , but I have no idea what is this \" more \" .\nBefore that I had always thought about getting married and having kids as a way to find happiness , but now I think that before this I need to do other things .\nIt is very interesting to think that it was necessary meet someone new , from another entire different culture to make me think about what I want .\nIt is very strange that another person became curious about a very profound part of me that I have never thought of .\nWell , next November I will travel to Europe , the only certain thing on my Bucket List that I know .\nHowever , now I have an awful feeling about what I am doing today , because for the first time in my life I am sure that I need change something , and I think this \" something \" is almost everything .\nPeoples lives will change in the future , and I bet it 's not for the better .\nUnlike popular understandings of History ( and even presumably scientific ones , I must say ) , History is not an unstoppable march towards \" progress \" , whatever that word means .\nIt is a ciclical process .\nRome had its hayday in the first century AD , but just three centuries later it was only a shadow of its past .\nThose later period Romans were n't even able to make the high quality cement that their ancestors were able to make and have technical mastery over just a few centuries earlier .\nAnd who can safely say that three centuries from now humans will possess all the technological knowledge that they possess now and take for granted ?", "No one can assure such a thing .\nBut I do n't think , unless there 's another World War , people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .\nI think in the next 50 years the age of technology will have its peak , and after that there will be a decline , until a new Dark Ages .\nBut let 's pick the World War hypothesis for a second .\nA wide world war is the only case in which we would see a dramatic change in peoples lives in the time length of 50 years from now .\nBut there 's , at this day , prospects for a new World War ?\nI do n't think so , but on the other hand what the hell do I know ?\nThe causes that will lead to a new World War may well be in existence right now for all I know , and no one , or only a few very wise and intelligent people know about it .\nOne day in the future another Franz Ferdinand could be killed , and that symbolic event could serve again as an escuse to some country declare war to another , but the true underlying causes that actually led the countries to wage war against each other would have its roots in much older times .\nAs the causes of the Second World War had its roots on events that were the outcome of the First War , a Third , hypothetical war , could have its roots on a past conflict that may well have happenned already .\nBut let 's not digress into that , that 's all another topic that falls beyond the scope of the statement on which I was supposed to write a composition .", "To : Sam\nFrom : Simonetta\nDate :

great !\nIt would be terrific if you came with me , is it possible ?\nCould you ask your parents ' permission ?\nIn this Camp parents are calm and do n't worry about their children because they are in the care of a large number of assistants and the camp is situated on an entire island .\nIn addition , the site was purpose built to provide places fit for young people allowing them to do lots of activities in safety .\nThere are a wide range of activities promoted by the staff all with the aim of enjoyment , especially outdoor sport activities !\nThere are two swimming pool , two tennis court , one football pitch , canoeing courses and so on but what I like most is the scuba diving , and the equipment is provided .\nThe Camp is well - known and opens from May to October and it would be good to book within two weeks , it always get overbooked for the period my parents can take days off , what do you think coming with us from the 1st august to the 15th ?\nI am look forward to

been missing for 15 years ...\nI did not know that he was still alive .\nMother had always told me he had died in the war .\nI think she did this for my own good .", "I was very bemused by the situation and did n't know if I liked him or not .\nIn my dreams I had seen him as an intellectual but now he was in my sitting room and he looked like an elephant or something exotic .\nIt was very

square of Brussels .\nIt is surrounded by several old buildings such as the city hall and the buildings of the corporations of the Middle Ages .", "These were groups of people doing the same work , such as carpenters .\nThey helped each other and the elders ones taught the youngsters .\nSometimes , they became very rich .\nEach building is decorated with the blazon of the corporation .\nTheir architecture is unique and beautiful .\nToday , most of them are hosting caf\u00e9s , shops and restaurants that attracts a lot of tourists , but there is also the city museum .\nThe square is covered with pavement and is a pedestrianized area .\nIt is an important place for the history because it is the oldest Grand Place of Europe and it is a part of the oldest neighbourhood of Brussels which is made of narrow paved streets , old and high buildings and , among other things , chocolate shops .\nRecently , several of the buildings have been restored and we can now better see their beautiful gilding and carvings .", "Every year , when Christmas comes , there is an amazing show with music and lights on the fa\u00e7ades of the buildings while a huge fir tree is placed in the centre of the square .\nWawel Royal Castle is one of the highest ranked monuments in the history and culture of Poland and Europe , so during the stay in Poland it is necessary to visit it .\nThe first Castle , called palatium , was built in 11th century , the remains of it are still visible inside the walls .\nDuring the next centuries it was expanded , and in 16th century finally rebuilt in a Renaissance fashion , which remained unchanged until today - the most representative remnant is probably famous arcaded coutyard .\nDuring the tour the visitors are shown several room and apartaments , as well as Royal Private Apartaments with far - famed tapestries of Polish ' kings collection .\nAnother attraction of the tour is visiting the Crown Treasury , where Polish coronation insignia were stored , and armoury .\nApart from the featured , there are also many marvellous exhibitions in the Castle containing its history as well as the other collections .\nWhile visiting Wawel Royal Castle one can not omit seeing Dragon 's Den - a cave under the Castle , where , according to the oldest legends , the dragon of Wawel lived .\nI recommend visiting Wawel Royal Castle because of its beauty and uniqueness .\nIt is a symbol of a thousand years of the Polish history and culture .\nEveryone will find something interesting among the variety of exhibitions and tours , and for certain it will be a memorable experience .\nI have been learning English as a second language since I was ten years old , which means a very long time ago .\nI think I am very lucky then because I have had the opportunity of learning English in a natural way , without books and tough lessons .\nMy teachers thought it was better to learn by speaking , singing , and doing other activities in English , in a way similar to how we learn our own mother language .\nMoreover , I travelled to England and lived with English families for a few weeks every summer since I started learning until I was fifteen years old .\nSo I grew up thinking I could speak and write quite good English .\nEven though I do have little theoretical knowledge about English grammar rules , I can make myself understood in a normal conversation , and I can write an email to a friend without making too many mistakes .\nOne year ago I decided to take the Cambridge Advanced English exam in order to test my knowledge , thinking It would be not very difficult for me to be successful .\nI decided to enrol for a creative writing course in order to practise my writing skills .\nAlong the course I had to accomplish some writing assignments and submit them to be evaluated by my peers .\nAnd there I realised at least two things : the first one that it is possible to learn how to write better ; the second one that even when you can make yourself generally understood , It is not so easy to be precise .\nA magician uses a dove and a black hat , but it would n't be a magic show if he did n't know how to perform the trick .\nIn the same way I had the ideas and the words but I had to admit that I needed to learn the rules of grammar if I wanted to do the magic trick of precise and stylish writing .\nAdolescence .\nEverybody say it 's the best period in our whole life ; what they do n't rembember is that it could be also the worst .\nAdolescence could be compared to a foggy path and even when it seems you can see something threw it , in reality you do n't .\nThis awful fog is composed by our uncontrolled emotions .\nEverything is unknown , but we try to pretend that we know a lot of things .\nThis could be one of the reason why we get angry so easily and so often with our parents : every time we descover something new or we say something , they judge us or they begin some long speeches to try to change our ideas .\nAnother thing about the relationship between parents and adolescents is the fact that they confuse our minds .\nAs I said adolescents could be very confused and if there 's a thing that get under our skinn is when moms say something and then tell us to do the opposite one .\nThe worst part is that they get angry with us !", "We 're confused , they 're not clear and then they also get angry and they 're surprised when we get mad at them !\nIt 's true that we should always be respectful but sometimes it turns out to be impossible because they do everything to provoke us .\nI think the most important thing in the relationship with our parents is to find a sort of accordance , because in the end we do n't only feel anger for them but also a lot of love .\nLove : That 's a new feeling that adolescents have to face .\nIt 's not the usual love they 're used to feel , as love for family and friends , but it 's a new kind of love .\nIt 's a kind of love that struggles ; it makes butterflies fly in our stomach , it makes us dive into a sort of imaginary tale .\nThat kind of love that we see in movies and we dream of ; the type of love that does n't make us fall usleep at night .\nIt is a period in which we have our first experiences , and it is as scary as exciting .\nAdolescence it is like this , there 's a moment that looks magical and in the following one you drown into the dark .\nDear group leader ,", "First of all , I would like to thank you for the interest shown to our small village .\nI really hope that you have a nice welcome and , please , feel at home .\nHere , in Mallorca , there are a lot of places to visit but I will recommend you a unique place , without tourists , noise and crowded beaches .\nOn the east of Mallorca you will find a small and beautiful village called Art\u00e0 .\nIn the municipality of Art\u00e0 you will find a coaster town , situated on the edge of the mountain range of Llevant .\nSa Col\u00f2nia de Sant Pere is a traditional fishermen village .\nNowadays , you can still see some fishermen fishing on the seashore .\nHere your adventure starts .\nIn order to get to your destination you must ride a bicycle and just enjoy the splendid panoramic view .\nYou will ride until Ca los cans , one of the most enigmatical beaches of Mallorca .\nThis zone is part of a protected area , a natural park .\nFor that reason , you must go riding a bike or walking .\nAs Machado said \" se hace camino al andar \" .\nIt means that the most important is the way , the journey .\nGoing on a bike near the seashore with the breeze of the sea is one of the most relaxing experiences in life .\nOn the way to Ca los cans , you will see the typical Mediterranean vegetation .\nThere are a lot of trees called \" tamarells \" , native trees of the coast of Mallorca .\nMoreover , you will go between two ancient obelisks which have been recently restored .\nFinally , you will get to Ca los Cans .\nIt is a special beach with stones instead of sand and surrounded by trees instead of hotels .\nThere you can practise different sports .\nIt is a perfect place to go diving because you can see different fishes , sea urchins and seaweed .\nThere you can also take a canoe and paddle in the quite sea .\nA part from sports , you should note two different culture points .\nOn the one hand , there is what remains standing of edificatications that were used to keep the small boats of the local fishermen save from storms .\nOn the other hand , there is a prehistorical tower called \" Talaiot \" .\nThe function of the Talaiots is not clear yet .\nMaybe it was a defensive tower or an important building for high - class people .\nIt is important to stay in the beach until the sun goes down .\nThe sunset in that place is ideal and romantic ( especially if you are with your partner ) and you will see how the sun goes behind the mountain range of Tramuntana .\nFrom that seashore you can see all the Alc\u00fadia bay , part of the mountain range of Tramuntana and the cape of Formentor .\nCa los Cans is a mixture of sea , nature and culture .\nI am sure that you will like it and , of course , I need to ask you a favour : Please , keep the secret .\nRegards ,", "Paula .", "Introduction .\nThe aim of this report is to outline the best and the worst qualities of your centre after one year running .\nThis report analyses the two main facilities : the gym and the swimming pool .\nThe gym .\nThe machines are fantastic and the staff is very helpful with every customer .\nOn the other hand , the gym is too small .\nEvery afternoon it is crowded so it is very difficult to do exercise .\nThe swimming pool .\nIt is ideal for people who do not compete because of its length , about 20 metres .\nFurthermore , it is not too deep , so it is excellent for people who want to learn how to swim .\nOn the other hand , the changing rooms are too far from this facility , so it is easy to catch a cold when someone goes from one place to another .\nConclusions .\nThe facilities are quite modern and the staff are excellent but the gym could be bigger .\nFurthermore , you would put heaters to avoid colds in the passage way from the changing rooms to the swimming pool .\nThe Future of Public Transport\nWhen we imagine future , we rarely imagine overcrowded buses and rusty subway trains .\nAs technologies develop and become cheaper more and more people buy personal cars .\nA car allows us to move faster and not to depend on others .\nTravalling by car is also much more convenient .\nDoes this all mean that the years of public transportation come to an end ?\nIn my opinion , it is not true .\nFirstly , there will always be people who will not be able to afford to buy a car .\nStudents , children from large families , old people will continue to use public transportation for a long time .\nSecondly , cars can also turn into public transport .\nScience fiction often depicts future as the world where cars are used freely .\nAnyone can use the nearest car he or she sees .\nThirdly , people do not have an inborn driving skill , so even in the future children and teenagers will need public transportation .\nThis is also true for older people , who lose the ability to drive as they age .\nIn conclusion , public transportation is not likely to disappear , at least during the nearest tens of years .\nThe chart above gives some information about the average monthly salaries of nurses and doctors in four different countries .\nAccording to the chart , the two countries with the lowest salaries are Country A and Country B.\nThese ones are called \" source countries \" , which means that they provide a supply of health care workers to other countries .\nOtherwise , the countries with the highest saliaries are country C and country D. Differently from the first two countries , these ones are called \" destination countries \" because the health care service is provided by foreign and qualified workers .\nMoreover , in the first three countries doctors earn about twice as much as a nurse earns , apart from the last country , Country D. In this one , the salary gap between doctors and nurses is bigger than in other countries .\nIn Country D , the salaries of doctors are about three times higher than those of nurses .\nIn conlcusion we can say that from the standpoint of the doctors and nurses , working abroad is a much better deal .\nBoxing is a common , well known and well loved sport amongst most countries in the world however it is also punishing , dangerous and disliked to the extent that many people want it banned , possibly with good reason .\nBoxing is a dangerous sport , there are relatively common deaths , tragic injuries and even disease .\nAll professional boxers are at risk from being killed in his next fight .\nIf not killed then more likely paralysed .\nThere have been a number of cases in the last ten years of the top few boxers having tragic losses throughout their ranks .\nThis is just from the elite few , and there s more from those below them .\nMore deaths would occur through boxing if it were banned .\nThe sport would go underground , there would be no safety measures like gloves , a doctor , paramedics or early stopping of the fight if someone looked unable to continue .\nWith this going on the people taking part will be dangerous , and on the streets .\nDangerous dogs who were trained to kill and maim in similar underound dog fights have already proved deadly to innocent people , the new boxers could be even more at risk .\nOnce boxing is banned and no - one grows up knowing it as acceptable there will be no interest in boxing and hopefully less all round interest in violence making towns and cities much safer places to live in , there will be less fighting outside pubs and clubs and less violent attacks with little or no reason .\nchange the rules of boxing slightly would much improve the safety risks of the sport and not detract form the entertainment .\nThere are all sorts of proposals , lighter and more cushioning gloves could be worn , ban punches to the head , headguards worn or make fights shorter , as most of the serious injuries occur in the latter rounds , these would all show off the boxers skill and tallent and still be entertaining to watch .\nEven if a boxer is a success and manages not to be seriously hurt he still faces serious consequences in later life diseases that attack the brains have been known to set in as a direct result of boxing , even Muhamed Ali , who was infamous ( ? ) both for his boxing and his quick - witted intelligence now has Alzheimer disease and can no longer do many everyday acts .\nMany other sports are more dangerous than boxing , motor sports and even mountaineering has risks that are real .\nBoxers chose to box , just as racing drivers drive .\nIn many of the minority works of modern literature , there can be some emphasis on rebellion against oppressive forces .\nAlthough such a show of strength by these works ' characters is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contribution to the otherwise insightful thought of the author , it is this conflict upon which many stories of ethnic American literature are based .\nHowever , such a rebellion can not be seen clearly in each minority work , and , therefore , the products of ethnic American literature can not be catagorized as merely the result of years of oppression .\nRather , this ever - changing and ever - challenging aspect of minority literature creates an especially important necessity that each work be considered individually as both a product of years of struggle and a work inherently distinct from any other .\nIn the minority works , the conflict and rebellion presented accurately reflects society as a whole , and although the mother 's in The Joy Luck Club rebel against such forces as arranged marriages , Tita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old family traditions , and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to secure their inherent rights from the US government , the characters ' conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures .\nRebellion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding force between all cultures , for Celie , too , resists her arranged marriage in The Color Purple , and the murderous loves in Jazz reflect Tita and Pedro 's destructive passion in Like Water for Chocolate .\nRebellion and conflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature , but they are portrayed no more strongly in minority works than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .\nEmphasis changes with each work , and although figures of authority are particullary oppressive in works such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Color Purple , other minority works including Love Medicine and Jazz do not reflect the clearly defined authoritarian figures nor the obvious rebellion of the characters ' responsive action which the previously mentioned works show .\nThis again implies that these etnic American pieces of literature can not be catagorized as merely rebellious responses to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences .\nHow does Voltaire tackle the question of philosophical optimism in ' Candide ' ?\nPhilosophical optimism -l'optimisme- is the philosophy that everything and occurence is for some good .\nVoltaire sets out in Candide to criticise this philosophy .\nIn Candide the representative of this philosophy is Pangloss , the philosopher employed at Thunder - der - Troncks .\nThe whole book is a criticism of l'optimisme .\nFor example when Candide is forced to join the Bulgar army he is beaten almost to death but Candide does not concern himself because he know it is for his own good - in fact later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier .\nAlthough this would seem to be good it is not because of his training he kills two men , a Jew and an Archbishop with no hesitation and then proceeds to kill his sweethearts brother .\nVoltaire show his dislike of l'optimisme when Pangloss , Candide and James are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only three survivors , Candide , Pangloss and a sailor .\nThe storm was caused by an earthquake which destroys the city to which Candide was sailing to .\nOn arrival they see starvation and death .\nCandide is obviously horrified , especially when the sailor begins pillaging the city .\nCandide looks to Pangloss for an answer but Pangloss can only tell him that some good will come of it .\nCandide , although remaining true to the ideals of optimism , always appears to be sceptical of it .\nThis is no more true than when he arrives in the new world , South America , and has to leave his darling Cun\u00e9gonde with the Commissioner of the province .\nCandide can not see what possible good can come of this especially as the reason that he was in America was due to him killing the Jew and Archbishop because they were Cun\u00e9gonde 's lovers .\nThroughout the book we begin to see how Candide is gradually lead away for l'optimisme or perhaps more importantly how l'optimisme is shown to be the philosophy of despair .\nThe constant belief that good can come from bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constant flow of disasters .\nCandide 's life , in the book , appears to show this .\nHe is thrown out of Thunder - den - Tronck because he embraces Cun\u00e9gonde , he is duped into the army , he is caught in an earthquake , he is almost killed as part of an auto - da - f\u00e9 , he kills three churchmen , he is almost eaten , he finds Eldorado but leaves- the list continues .\nCandide 's life is governed by his belief the good will prevail .\nEventually , of course , he does marry Cun\u00e9gonde but she is not the beautiful young flower that he once loved .\nShe has become ugly and grew worse by the day .\nThis illustrates emphatically the folly of l'optimisme .\nCandide has travelled the world in search of Cun\u00e9gonde , with the hope that he will marry her despite all the trouble which he has gone through , of course in the end he does get Cun\u00e9gonde but at the price of her looks and personality .\nVoltaire , in Candide , shows how the philosophy of Optimism is one of despair not hope .\nIt would be tempting to think of the various European Communities as an embryonic United States of Europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of European Unity .", "However it is important to realise that Europe is a very long way from becoming anything like the United States .\nWhen the original 13 American states resolved to form what is now the United States of America , they were intent on forming a political as well as economic entity .\nThey were prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allow the newly formed national government to operate as a single international political force .\nA balance was therefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual states as much self - government as possible while ensuring that , for example in military matters , the central government spoke for all .\nIt is true that today one still hears the old dispute over state sovereignty and attempts to return some power to the individual states , but no - one would challenge the fact that , on matters external to the United States , the government in Washington represents the sole policy - making body .\nIn Europe it is quite clear that many people would like to see a political union of the countries since this would produce a formidable international military force .\nHowever it is equally clear that while there might be some unified political action flowing from the European Communities ( such as was seen over Europe 's response to the British involvement in the Falkland Islands dispute ) , the Communities were intended as purely economic entities in the first place .\nMembership almost certainly involves some loss of national sovereignty , but the United Kingdom could probably leave the community by a simple majority vote in the Westminster Parliament , something which no state in the United States could lawfully do .\nWe are still a very long way from a Single Parliament for Western Europe with power to make political decisions for all ; and even with 1992 approaching and a single market the gulf between the UK and Europe is very wide .\nThe supremacy of Parliament will never be challanged .\nIts ability to make and break any law - made by it or Europe - means that it retains full sovereignty .\nEven if today it made laws to that would unite it fully with Europe and relinquish its sovereignty for ever , it could tomorrow repeal all those laws .\nThe fact that Parliament does not bind itself or can not be bound by any political body means that it can never lose its sovereignty unless a majority of the population wished it and Parliament consented .\nBut with the average jingoistic Briton there is no chance of us curing ourselves of our xenophobia and ever wishing to be fully intergrated with Europe .\nEven now the channel tunnel has joined us to the continent we still consider ourselves to be separated from the world standing alone against a hostile world .\nNaturally , the problems of a single Europe would run as deeply as the benefits that we would presumably ultimately receive .\nIt seems to me that for the past few centuries , Britain has always considered itself to be detached from the rest of Europe .\nWhenever necessary , she has allied herself to European powers , such as in times of war of extreme distrust .\nBritain has been eager to maintain a secure balance of power on the continent , but throughout history , she has been more concerned with her oversees empires than with anywhere else .\nIn the latter half century though , her empire has diminished and she has had to face mounting responsibility in Europe .\nBecause of her history of isolated sovereignty it is difficult to accept being a part of a single Europe .\nFor instance , British law is based largely upon precedent , that is judge made law .\nWe have established a system of law which dates back many centuries , and which is widely known and respected .\nThere is very little European influence on our law , of course in many respects it will be the same , but the lack of influence will display many differences .\nWith the creation of a single Europe , new law will have to be accepted throughout the continent , and it will cause both confusion and conflict .\nThe British tend to be very proud and possessive of the law , and changes may well cause illfeeling and discontent .\nOf course , the same points will apply to the monetary system in Europe .\nWill there just be one system ?\nThe country typically is against major change and something as fundamental as money would cause problems if it was to be altered .\nOur individual monetary system I suppose , could be seen as a symbol of sovereignty .\nIt can be said that if a single Europe was created , problems may arise over its fundamental political concepts .\nOf course Britain would lose her sovereignty , as would the other nations of the union .\nIt has been suggested that the Single Union could be based on a basic federal structure , whereby local autonomy could be saved , but the union as a whole could work together in a democratic manner .\nTo a certain extent , even if sovereignty was lost , some national personality would be preserved .\nThe fact is that , when united , European unity would still in essence be divided .\nThere will always be aspects of one society that the others will never accept .\nEurope as a whole faces the same problems , and therefore , if a single Europe was created , uniting Britain , the problems could be dealt with quickly and efficiently .\nIf the Federalists achieved their aims in a European unity , they would do their best to achieve democracy and promote it nationally , so that individuality is preserved , and that all of their positive features will be known .\nThe problem facing the British , really results from their isolated past .\nThe sovereignty of the nation has deep roots , and the fears of losing it are very great .\nWhether this would happen awaits to be seen , and would depend completely on the terms of the union , and the negotiations and feelings of the general public and the politicians leading the countries .\nWith 1992 now only a year away , the question of what a Single Europe will mean for Britain becomes increasingly relevant .\nI firmly believe that the advent of 1992 will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain .\nThis loss need not however be negative .\nIn fact , in political , economic and defence terms I feel this realocation of resources can and will be very positive .\nWhilst to a certain extent I may be guilty of having an island mentality , I would n't go as far as to say Britain is in danger of handing all control over to faceless beaurocrats in Brussels or Strasbourg .\nThroughout the world a wind of change is apparent , but especially so in Europe .\nThis process will continue and Europe the rest of the world will evolue with or without the participation of Britain in this process .\nIt is my belief that Britain must be involved in the decision making which will eventually decide the new world order .\nHowever to be fully involved , sacrifices have to be made .\nSuch sacrifices will involve certain aspects of our sovereignty .\nIn relenquishing and thus centralising certain powers , the aim is not to diminish the strength of individual nations but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world stage .\nAs amply demonstrated by recent events in the Gulf , European cooperation in the field of defence can be both impressive and effective . Whilst I would be reluctant to hand over all control to defence to any central body .\nI can see a future for some form of European rapid reaction force .\nWhilst to an extent crippling defence costs could be cut this would not necessarily lead to a reduction in the size of defence available .\nIn political terms , regardless of legislation , Britain like the rest of Europe is becoming increasingly cosmopolitan in terms of the population composition .\nThe North Sea will increasingly come to represent a mere puddle as people move between countries .\nI feel it is important for Britain to join fully with its European partners to adapt to these changes in demography .\nPolitically we are moving closer together .\nPossible problems should be studied and solved if possible before they happen .\nE.R.M. is already upon us but in this area I feel Britain should be especially careful .\nWhilst not pretending to fully understand this system I do know that no system can lower interest rates , and inflation while raising growth , with the possible exception of the Magic Circle .\nIn the area of the single currency , again I feel this is inevitable .\nWhat is important is to base this currency on the strong currencies within the EEC as opposed to an average based system .\nTo conclude I would say a single Europe is already happening and that it will continue to do so is guaranteed .\nBritain must not concern itself with loss of sovereignty but gain of the European equivalent .\nIf we miss the boat I think we will drawn before the next boat comes .\nWhen the treaty of Rome was signed in 1957 , the foundation was laid for a new \" continent \" - a united Europe .\nIt was said that Europe would not be created quickly , but over several years .\nWhen Britain entered the European Community in 1973 after a national referendum , the debate began concerning Britains relationship with Europe .\nWhen 1992 was set as the date for the single European Market , the debate flared up again , but over how far Britain should be integrated .\nThe rest of Europe seems prepared for 1992 but Britain seems to be decidedly hesitant .\nThe former Prime Minister , Margaret Thatcher was not been to lead Britain into a United Europe because she felt it would lead to a loss of our sovereignty .\nThere is no doubt an integrated market would have multiple benefits for the countries involved .\nBusinesses and other trading organizations are preparing themselves for 1992 , and the single market .\nTrade will be easier , with no frontier controls allowing free flowing transportation of merchandise .\nThere will be business booms and free competition with the removal of protective practices , along with greater freedom to travel .\nMany Britons would consider Europe has affected Britain too much already , with decimalization , the new Euro - passports and now the pound sterling being tied to the ECU .\nThey may feel Britain is being pulled into Europe .\nFurther changes are forecast for Britain , effecting day to day matters , to create a \" European Standard \" .\nThis may make Britons resentful of Europe and tired of \" 1992 and all that \" .\nA single market requires one central institution to co - ordinate all movements of goods and policies .\nWill the people of Britain be prepared to give up their government and be directed from Strasbourg or Brussels ? .\nMany people would not .\nWill the day come when the pound sterling is taken over by the ECU ?\nIt may well - but will the Britons have a chance to voice their opinions and views ?\nEurope may argue that the benefits from a single integrated market would far outweigh any national drawbacks .\nAs the date draws nearer , the awareness of Britons to Europe must increase .\nThey must look into the future and consider possible effects .\nWill Britain be drawn into Europe against its will ?\nPerhaps as more of Britain becomes \" Eurofied \" , Britons will wake up and see their sovereignty is being taken away .\nBritain has never geographically been a part of Europe .\nWe are in the EEC and we should be able to benefit from free trade .\nWe have been an island for too long - being independent and able to stand alone .\nWe have a sound democratic process , which many people would not want to give this up .\nA fully integrated market with Britain as a full member would be to the detriment of our political system and consequently leading to a loss of sovereignty .\nThere has been such a lot of talk about a Single Europe in recent years that it is hard to believe that it will be upon us very soon .\nNow that it is a reality , and not just a probability , the question in the minds of many Britons is indeed : Will this mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain or the birth of a nation ?\nFirstly , a positive approach .", "Looking at things from an economic perspective , this is not a problem .\nThe benefits in terms of cost - cutting owing to doing things once , instead of twelve times , will be enormous .\nFirms , because of being able to pool their resources , will be able to devote more time to research and development , and thus products will improve .\nEurope will therefore be a nation to be reckoned with as regards competition .\nTo look at things on a more individual level , every member of the new Single Europe 's standard of living should increase .\nA greater potential of ideas from a greater number of experts will , in theory , result in more knowledgeable and better - informed individuals .\nSimplicity is one of the Commission 's key aims , with the idea that if things are simpler and more easy for everyone to understand people will be happier , get on better .\nIf this is so , they should also work better .", "Ideally then , there should be more equality , less crime , greater productivity and greater economic growth .\nOn the other hand , will this Single Europe mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain ?\nIt must be remembered that not only does Britain have a small population compared to the majority of the other member states , but it is an island - which none of the others are .\nWhy should this matter ?\nWell , Britain has quite a history and therefore a fair number of traditions .\nIt is possible that it could become engulfed in the new Single Europe and lose its identity .\nBritons ( especially those from older generations ) may then feel \" lost \" and that they do not really \" belong \" any more .\nThe new Single Europe may be too new and unknown for them to make their allegiance to it .\nThen there is the question as to whether all this idealism really will work .\nWill there be greater prosperity , better - informed , happier citizens , or will this never come off because of politicians being unable to agree on policies ?\nBritain , although small , is more often than not in the fore of international matters , taking a definite stance on what it considers to be right .\nHas it then not got quite a lot at stake , its character at least , in integrating itself into this Single Europe ?\nNo one would dispute that this is a difficult question .\nThe fact remains however that next year ( in 1992 ) there is going to be a Single Europe .\nThis , as everyone is well aware , is not going to be achieved with ease , but the more tolerant every member state is of each other , the more successful the Single Europe will be .\nIt is up to Britain therefore to accept this fact and to show an example by leading the way as regards tolerancy .\nThen we will all be able to look at the future in a more positive way .\nThe European Community is a unique grouping of twelve sovereign European Member States who are committed to the development of closer economic and political co - operation .\nThe community has an aim to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe .\nIn particular , the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its frontiers ; movement not only of goods but of services , capital and people .\nHowever , the issue of sovereignty is certainly a much debated one ; to what extent should a member hand over its sovereignty to the Community , if at all ?\nLet us look at the founding of the European Community , before we discuss the issue of sovereignty in more detail .\nThere were several attempts at peaceful unification after the First World War , but only after Europe had again been devastated by war was the futility of national rivalry truly apparent .\nThe political and economic exhaustion of the European states called for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re - ordering of Europe .\nThis fresh start came about because of three main factors .\nFirstly , was Europe 's realization of her own weakness , after having lost her age - old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union .\nThese superpowers were economically , militarally and politically stronger than the divided individual European states .\nSecondly was the conviction that military conflict should in the future be avoided ; after all , the two great wars had both begun as European \" civil wars \" . Thirdly was the common desire for a better , freer world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way .\nOne of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community , in 1958 .\nIts membership has grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty - three .\nOne of the most innovative features of the European Community compared with other international bodies is that the member states have ceded to it a part of their national sovereignty and endowed it with its own sovereign powers , which it can use to adopt acts , having the force of national law .\nThis novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called \" integration \" .\nThe 1970 's saw progress in integration , with the introduction of community policy instruments , which enabled greater scope for national policies .\nAll of the member states agree in principle to the idea of a single market by 1992 , however each wish their own interests to be safeguarded .\nThis is to say that none want to sacrifice their national sovereignty , many want unanimous voting , not majority voting .\nMany see this issue as a threat to their own regulations and laws , and could foresee a drop in standards if they do not stand firm .\nThe situation is seen as a threat to the countries in question who do not wish to boldly give up their sovereignty for the sake of European unity .\nWhether or not the continuation of the progress in the field of European unity is sucessful depends very much on the people of Europe .\nIf a feeling of European unity develops and can be sustained , the threat will subside as a feeling of identity takes over .\nOn Britains roads there is an ever increasing volume of traffic .\nThe road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without hold - ups and traffic jams ..\nTo remedy this the government has started adding a fourth lane on some streches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and bypasses , with mixed reception .\nWhile the road system is being improoved there seems to be an endless series of roadworks which restrict the highways and cause further delay while the roadworks are in place .\nThe inability to cope with the ammount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic .\nIt might seem an easy soloution to this mayhem would be to use public transport ; i.e. the Railways .\nPeople are not taking to the Rail system because of its lack of integration due to the recent privitisation of different areas .\nIt has been shown that different companies charge different fares for exactly the same route !\nThe main disadvantage with the railways is as the rail service and the bus service are normally owned by different companies it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train .\nIf the services were integrated there would be a bus time table which coincided with the train arrival times .\nThen people would be more likely to catch the train as they would not have to look forwards to a long walk , wait for a bos or an expensive taxi ride .\nMy soloution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services , this would get people of the roads and onto the trains .\nTo improove the rail service trains have got to be timed to arrive and depart at key times i.e. arrive at eight o'clock and leave at half past six .\nThe train and bus companies have to liase with each other and the train fares have to remain relatively cheap i.e. the same price or less as it would cost to go by car .\nThe basic dilema facing the UK 's rail and road transport system is the general rise in population .\nThis leads to an increase in the number of commuters and transport users every year , consequently putting pressure on the UKs transports network .\nThe biggest worry to the system is the rapid rise of car users outside the major cities .\nMost large cities have managed to incourage commuters to use public transport thus decreasing major conjestion in Rush hour periods .\nPublic transport is the obvious solution to to the increase in population if it is made cheep to commuters , clean , easy and efficient then it could take the strain of the overloaded British roads .\nFor commuters who regularly travel long distances rail transport should be made more appealing , more comfortable and cheaper .\nMotorways and other transport links are constantly being extended , widened and slowly turning the country into a concrete jungle yet it is only trying to cope with the increase in traffic , we are our own enemy !\nAnother major problem created by the mass of vehicle transport is the pollution emitted into the atmosphere damaging the ozone layer , creating smog and forming acid rain . Tourturing the Earth we are living on .\nIn concluding I wish to propose clean , efficient comfortable and cheap public transport for the near future .\nThe modern traffic jam is now a familiar situation to nearly all of the western worlds population .\nIf every time we use our cars to travel any distance we find ourselfs in a 10 mile tail - back why do we still insist that that we travel in such ameander .\nTo illistrate my point , if every time you took a train , it stops for 2 hours on the track , everyone would stop taking it .\nSo why do we still insist on travelling on the road .\nThe answer most likly lies in 2 areas , firsty the attitude of many westerners is that \" it is their right to travel in such a mannor ' .\nThis is in my opinion , shows considerable ignorance .\nI am by far and away no ' greeny ' who wants to make everyone live in tipee 's and eat soya bean soup , however I do agree that somthing should be done about the volume of traffic that is on our roads today .\nThe governments answer to the considerably growing amount of traffic on our roads it just to back move , they are not even attempting to treat the cause , thent more and more people are now driving .\nWe all feel that we have a divine right to be on the road .\nWhy ?\nDo we , the westeren world ( 5% of the population of the world ) , have the right to use the resources of the rest of the world at the environmental cost ?\nJust beause we can not be bothered to get out of bed a bit earilene to catch public transport .\nEven if we did , then shorly so does the rest of the world .\nThat could have disasterous implications .\nThe 2nd reason , is the promblem that the public transport service , for example rail , is declining so much , there is no train to catch in the morning .\nPeople stopped using trains because of the fall in standards , these people were forced onto the road , routes became unprofitable and so were closed and services cut back , forcing more people onto the roads .\nThe whole system has now formed a spiraling circle of road use .\nThis has now been intensifyed with the sale of the railways , to privite rail companys , profit motivated .\nThe vital , small rail links may now be closed , priviously they where subsudised to make up the loss , now the privite companies can not afford to do this so many will close , cutting off small towns and villages .\nThe only way to stop the circle will be to break it , the only people to do this is the government or ourselves , If we make the effort to use public transport it will expand into a good service ; Unfortunatly the public seam to be appethetic to this idea .\nToday , boxing has become a very popular sport , with T.V. channels competeing for coverage of certain events and fighters earning a lot of money , this is a big business .\nApart from athletics , boxing seems to be the only popular international sport from which Britain can still hold to head high .\nWe have superb fighters with excellent character such as Lennox Lewis , Nigel Benn , Nasheem Hamed and our beloved Frank Bruno .\nDespite being enjoyable to watch , boxing is very dangerous .\nBlows to the head can cause the brain to rattle about the skull which may cause a brain clot or tumor .\nLast year , the fight between Chris Eubank and Micheal Watson led to calls for boxing to be banned when Micheal Watson slipped into a coma and was in a critical condition for some months .\nMany youths in low income areas see boxing as ' a way out ' , a chance to make it to the top and earn a lot of money on the way .\nThere are , however , people who regard boxing as barbaric , brutal and primitive .\nThese people argue that there is no need for boxing and that it only promotes violence .\nDuring the fight , yes , of course it is violent , but this is controlled violence and fighters have a mutual respect for each other .\nAll precautions are taken to ensure a safe fight .\nDuring fights doctors a kept close to the ring and have the authority to call it off prematurely if required .\nAmbulances are also kept on stand by at big events .\nAlthough it may sound cruel , I do not beleive that any fighter has entered a proffessional boxing career without knowing the risks .\nBecause there are so many budding young boxers , to ban boxing would be insane , since it would almost certainly go underground .\nUnderground fights are far more dangerous since less protective gear is used and there usually is n't a doctor present .\nTaking this into account and considering that boxing is about hurting the opponent , it can be said that boxing is a relatively safe sport .\nAlthough far less popular , there are other sports which are far more brutal and dangerous , such as ' Thai Boxing ' , where competitors are encourage to use their knees and elbows .\nThe argument continues , but for the sake of safety in the long term I do not think boxing will be banned .\nWhich is good news for the majority of the British public .\nTwo men , one ring , only one can leave . Dramatic it may be but basically that is the main principal of boxing .\nAlthough throughout the years rules have been made to dilute the sports sadistic side , should boxing be banned ?\nEvery time a boxer gets punched in the head his brain moves vigorously inside his skull .\nThis causes the boxer to lose many brain cells per boxing fight and if this occurs frequently then the boxer can end his career with brain damage .\nIn my eyes and probably the eyes of others this is reason enough for the banning of boxing .\nThe sport to say the least is actually a blood sport , the simple reason being that the idea of the sport is to ' knock your opposition out ' , although this is argued by Chris Eubank he believes he is a sportsman and the idea of boxing is an art form , he says that he does not specifically go into a boxing ring to knock his opponent out but to win on points differences and to give Chris Eubank his just respect most of his fights have been won on points .\nBut there is one exception - the original example , the first reference why boxing should be banned , the tragic accident where Michael Watson was put into a coma by Chris Eubank ( the man who does n't specifically go into fights to knock his opposition out ) .\nThis example only proves too well what a dangerous so called ' sport ' boxing is .\nThe boxing federation is trying to do as much as it can to make the ' spot ' safer having rungside doctors , banning bare hand fights but the top and bottom of the argument is that any blow to the head causes considerable damage .\nThere is always much speculation over the dangers of such a brutal sport as boxing .\nThis is emphasised and exaggerated when a competitor in the sport tragically dies .\nA recent death in the ring has inevitably led to a public uproar on the safety of the sport , and the controvesy over whether the sport should be banned or not is yet again the forefront of discussion .\nLet us consider how a professional boxer would feel .\nHe is clearly aware of the dangers and brutalism of the sport , which is possibly why he enjoys it so much .\nI have yet to hear any boxer regret his choice of career .\nThe excitement of being in the ring , the joy at knocking an opponent onto the canvass , and all the money that is there to be made are overwhelming factors which keep boxers fighting .\nThe money that is there for the taking for the very best of the best is ridiculous , and with some top boxers earning sums of money such as \u00a3 20 million ( or in Mike Tysons comeback case , $ 60 million ! ) it is hardly surprising how important the sport can be to some .\nLet us consider ' Sky ' viewes , recently beginning a subscription to view Tysons \" next Live Lights \" .\nThis member of the public does not want the sport to be banned either .\nNow let us consider the friends or family of a boxer , who has been permanently injured ( or been killed due to a fight ) .\nThese individuals and others learning about the tragic incident in the media protest against the sport .\nThe family , who were originally against the idea of their son finishing college early to take up the sport would be leading the protests againt boxing .\nHow pleased , proud and patriotic the British public felt when Frank Bruno achieved his ultimate goal and became the Heavyweight champion of the world , yet how sorry many were to see him return to boxing after his head injuries earlier in his career .\nThis hypocritical view is shoved by so many that whether boxing should be banned or not will remain a controversial issue for the forseeable future .\nThere were 2 main objections raised against the introduction of the national lottery .\nThe first was the objection that the lottery would be little more another form of taxation , in fact , none than that , a tax on the poor .\nThe second and main objection came from charities who predicted that charitable donations would go down with the introduction of the lottery , as people would be less likely to give money to charity , instead buying a lottery ticket , with the excuse that some of the money spent buying the ticket would go to charity .\nThere was also some controversy over the awarding of the lottery organisation franchise , which eventually went to Camelot , which was not seen as the strongest contender for the bid : other companies or consortiums promised to give more money to charity with lower running costs .\nRichard Bronson promised to give all of his profits to charity , but was rejected .\nMy personal objections to Camelot as the lottery organiser is that a large proportion of the consortium are american or foreign firms , for example IBM has a sizeable stake in Camelot .\nThe British national lottery run by non British firms .\nsince its introduction there has been more controversy over the national lottery .\nWhen it promised to give 45 pence in every pound to charitable causes , it neglected to promise that most or all of this money would go to charity .\nThere has also been some controversy over the allocation of money .\nFor example 3 million pounds were given to Eton college one of the richest public schools for a gymnasium money was also given to the royal opera house .\nThe lottery seamed to be a reverse Robin Hood : stealing from the poor to give to the rich .\nThe lottery has also suffered alegations that it is addictive , especially with the introduction of scratch cards .\nIt has been claimed that it is so addictive that people will spend all their availiable cash on lottery tickets , only to be disappointed .\nIt has been calculated that only 4 pence out of every pound recieved by the lottery goes to charitable causes , the rest is tax the prize fund , profits , and the so called charities .\nIt has also been calculated that the chance of winning anything substantial is one in millions , ie highly unlikely .\nIt has also been alleged that the jackpots are too high most of the lucky winners have said themselves that the jackpot had runed their life , alenating them from friends and family .\nIn conclusion , I think that the lottery should be retained , but not in its present form . I think that jackpots should be capped at 2 million pounds , and the prize fund shared between more people : it is better to give forteen people a fortune than to give fourteen fortunes to one person .\nI would also remove any american buisness interests and give the charity money to more diserving ' charity ' .\nNow the lottery is in place , it would be very difficult to remove it from society .\nThe computer has been one of the most influential inventions of all time .\nComputers now dominate the majority of government business , science and communication , as well as many other areas of human life .\nIn many ways , it has taken the place of the human brain in performing calculations and thought processes .\nThe most obvious example of this is the calculator , an instrument used by mathmeticians and scientists for making numerical calculations .\nThis has made it no longer necessary for the human to perform calculations and run through equations , and so need not understand the principles behind them any longer .\nThis , unfortunately , means that the genius scientist is being replaced by the powerful computer and its operator , who needs only to know which buttons to press .\nThis may seem an extreme view , as there is still much in the world of maths and science which a computer can not calculate , but this may not be the case centuries into the future .\nComputers have been used as a means of keeping records , they have all but superseded handwritten text , ( in a few decades people may well be faced with a computer screen and keyboard in their General Studies exam ) , they are used to transfer money across the globe , even to create artwork and to entertain .\nComputer generated pictures , including ' fractal ' pictures , drawn from equations , seem to be more popular than hand printed images from an artist 's imagination , and computer games seem to provide more entertainment than any game or activity that takes place in the real , physical world .\nVirtual reality allows people to have ' 3-D ' entertainment created for them by a computer .\nWhether or not the computer is taking over from the human brain , it has certainly made the human body all but redundant .\nPeople , businesses or corporations can be contacted at any point around the globe by fax machines , e - mail and the internet , and some people prefer these forms of communication to actually meeting face to face .\nMoney can be transferred instantly without even needing to move the actual money - the physical coinage does n't matter , it is the computer records that state how much each bank has ownership of .\nHowever , the idea that the human brain is no longer useful is not entirely true ( ! ) Computers can not deal with human beings , have no capacity for coping with anything outside their expected situations , and can not adapt to new situations using judgement .\nHuman beings often act without logic or reason , and only other human beings can cope and deal with that .\nAlso , computers can break down , and then a human is needed to take control - such as an airline pilot , and there are still certain tasks only a human being can perform , and they are often among the simplest .\nThey cried , they cheered .", "Their faces expressed joy , triumph , pride and perplexity .\nThe world watched in anticipation -- We were mesmirized by the images of the TV , expecting something new at every moment and not wanting to miss it -- I remember that day it was the only topic of conversation at school : \" Have you heard ? \" , \" I ca n't believe it ! \" , \" After all this time ! \" , \" I never thought it would happen .\n\" We all felt that we were living one of those historic moment that you read about in a history book and were proud to be a part of it -- It was November 9 , 1989 , the day that the Wall fell in Berlin-\nWithin a few weeks , the excitement had died down and people had turned their attention to more recent news .", "But for me , this had been the start .\nIt was the start of what our now as - President Bush likes to refer to as \" our \" winning of the Cold War --\nIt was the event that gave the people of the Eastern Bloc countries the hope that their efforts were not in vain -- For 40 years , the people had suffered under a communist regime that had not allowed them to express themselves freely or to leave their homelands in search of a new life -- Many people had tried to escape .\nSome had been executed -- I had a classmate whose father had escaped from Hungary -- He had left his family and friends , his whole life and had set out for Western Europe with little money .\nI had asked him once if he had n't been scared , scared of what he would find once he left --\nHe told me that nothing could compare to the way he had been forced to live his life there -- Even though I had lost touch with this classmate , her father 's words were with me as I watched the events unfold in Germany --\nBolstered by the Germans ' success , the people of Hungary , Tchekoslovaquia , Poland and Roumania rose against communist regimes as well -- Now , three years later , communism as we once knew it no longer exists .\nWhether the people are happier or not , I can not say --", "However , they will have at least seen the \" other side \" .\nTheir struggles and hopes of forty years will not have been in vain -- Without the \" events of Berlin Wall \" history probably would not have taken a very different course -- Eventually , I think that things would have turned out as they did --\nHowever , history can not be rewritten and as things stand the Fall of the Berlin Wall actively contributed to the resurgence of hope and struggle in the rest of the Eastern Bloc -- As such , it was the catalyst force that led to the end of the Cold War and therefore , though we may not always remember the other significant events , we will always remember the day the wall fell --\nThe development and implementation of technology has affected societies in every corner of the world .", "I do not speak of a certain object in particular , but of technology as a whole .\nThis thing , technology has been and will always be both the closest friend and yet the greatest Nemesis of our world .\nScience and technology have allowed me to travel to this part of the world , they have provided a living for my family , they have cured my grandmother of cancer , and they provide horizons of hope and knowledge in the fields of medicine , science , engineering , and even the less overt corners of our lives .\nThe use of the means humans have developed is wherein the greatest problems lie .\nAlone , they do not threaten us , but when they become welded with certain aspects of and certain people in our societies , they become potentially the most dangerous things that we hold in our hands .\nSpeaking from my experience living in the United States , I have come to feel that technology has become a large detriment to our youth in particular .\nPeople say that technological development has made our world much smaller ,\nand I would concur that a great majority of Americans live in their own personal closets .\nIn schools , Geography classes rarely , if ever , exist .\nBefore I came to Spain , a group of children asked me if Spain was in Michigan .\nExplaining that Spain was located across the ocean did not seem to improve their understanding of the layout of our world .\nScience and technology have had effects on the U.S. that can not be described , and I feel that its people have adopted the same \" I am a self - sufficient- I do n't need any help \" type of mentality that will slowly destroy us .\nOur awareness of other people , other cultures , and other languages is very low on the priority list of our educators .\nUntil I was 15 , I was unable to study any foreign language at all , and even at that time I had only one choice of languages- German .\nSince I was twelve , I had an intense desire to learn Spanish , and because of these circumstances , that I mentioned before , I had no choice but to wait until I was twenty years old to even begin to learn this language .\nMine is not the only experience like this .\nThe effort of the United States has caused our minds to be heard , and a world that is growing while my country lags behind in its selfish self - satisfaction .\nMany people argue nowadays that , with the advent of computer technology , our mental arithmetic is poor and we are becoming a nation of couch potatos .\nIt is true in a way , the development of portable calculating machines ( calculators ) has meant that we no longer need to be able to work out sums in our heads , but at what cost ?\nIn many shops , the cashiers appear to be dumbfounded by the simplest of sums without the aid of their tills .\nIn many areas , the skill of human judgement has been replaced by faster , more accurate , computers .\nMany people have had their job positions taken over by computers .\nFiling cabinets are becoming a thing of the past with computer databases .\nBut even such menial tasks as filing are good for us .\nThey encourage organisational skills and tidiness .\nWhen people talk about artificial intelligence ( AI ) , you hear many funny tales from people who are convinced that the computers are coming alive and will eventually rule us .\nThese are just the rantings of people who have nothing to do with computers and who do not realise that behind every computer is a programmer .\nEven ' artificial intelligence ' needs to be programmed .\nHuman brains still work out how to build the computers , how to program them and , more importantly , how to control them .\nAs for making the human brain redundant computers can help to improve learning skills , they can teach , test and improve our linguistic skills .\nReflexes are improved ( and this has been scientifically proven ) by playing computer games , the very same things that parents say turn their children into ' zombies ' .\nWe can expand our imagination and convert our ideas into computer simulated models , enabling us to design buildings and road networks .\nThe computer revolution has not made our brains redundant , it has opened up areas of them we never knew existed !\nIt is now the age of the computer .\nAlmost everyone owns a computer or has access to one .\nComputers nowadays are a far cry from the one 's in the past which filled whole rooms .\nThey are able to generate amazingly accurate graphical representations and perform extremely difficult mathematical equations in just seconds .\nComputers have become a huge part of our lives in both the areas of work and education .\nBut are they such a good thing ?\nWhen calculators came along a drop in ability of students for mental arithmetic was obvious and now they are used for the simplest calculations .\nThe computer could do the same thing .\nComputers encourage laziness in the general public , why work out something yourself when the computer can do it for you .\nThis is very time saving and efficient but it is causing people to forget basic ideas .\nFor instance , spelling is no longer as important as it was you can simply use a \" spellcheck \" to correct your English , which is absurd .\nFor the youth of today computers offer links around the world and millions of facts and figures .\nThis could be argued to be educational .\nHowever , this is killing the imagination of children and they spend hours sat at a keyboard tapping away in the doom and gloom of the house .\nThey should be out enjoying themselves and gaining experiences for themselves instead of reading about them on a flat screen .\nIt is said that you can meet people through computers and have ' relationships ' .\nI find this preposterous and people are losing the ability to communicate and form relationships .\nComputers can offer escape from the hum - drum routine of daily life by means of games but they are mind - numbing and un - inventive .\nThere is however a more dangerous threat from computers , it is that they can do the work for man .\nThis could lead to high unemployment .\nThose people who work with computers for long periods of time every day face problems .\nThe repetion of tapping keys all day and staring at the screen can be harmful and not only that it is highly boring to do the same thing over and over again .\nComputers may be the future but what part will man have in this future .\nThere will be no need for people to go to school as they could be taught at home , people would hardly ever talk and the only career available would be for computer programmers .\nI agree that computers are helpful but people should not live through their computers and be so reliant on them .\nThey should read books and live more in order to regain their lost imagination and sense of adventure .\nAlso , in schools I feel that work should be done mainly by hand and calculators and computers should only be used minimally in mathematics in order to stop the production of computer addicts and again have normal people .\nThere are many beneficial aspects of genetic manipulation .\nThese include : the erasion of identification of harmful hereditary genetic disorders and the development of hybrid high - yield crops .\nThere can be no doubt that genetic manipulation and genetic engineering have had highly beneficial effects on many areas of society .\nHowever , many people dislike or are prejudiced against , genetic manipulation .\nPartly this is a ' Fear of the unknown ' ; something which tampers with the intrinsic components of plant and animal life is beyond comprehension for most people , and therefore provokes fear .\nWhat people have also become aware of , is the immense power which genetic manipulation can give to certain individuals .\nThis has been very good to feed popular culture ( the film ' Jurassic Park ' being an obvious reference point ) .\nThere is also however , the very real possibility that the power of genetic manipulation could become the possession of uncontrolled unregulated individuals who could use it for ' evil ' purposes .\nThis then , is an argument against scientists bearing moral responsibility for their work .\nAnything in life can be misused .\nWhether it be a kitchen - knife used to stab someone , a car used to run someone over , or something as harmeless as a pillow used to suffocate .\nEverything in life , if misused , can have harmful effects and genetic engineering and genetic manipulation are no exception .\nThough the possible effects of genetic manipulation may be far larger than a kitchen - knife or car , this is purely a subjective view by present - day standards .\nCertainly we would not hold the makers of a car or kitchen - knife responsible for their misuse , and there is no reason why scientists should bear the major burden or responsibility if genetic manipulation is put to misuse .\nThe fundamental flaw in saying scientists must bear the major burden or moral responsibility for their work , is that if this had been applied universally for centuries , scientific research would never have taken place , and mankind would be without electricity , radios , quite simply , anything above the mud hut ' existence .\nScientific research is not a corrupt , but an essential and natural part of the human condition for bettering itself .\nThe other fundamental flaw is assuming that individual scientists have responsibility , Science is a process of discovery rather than creation , ie .\nno - one created genetic manipulation , the power of it was there to be discovered .\nIf one scientist does not make a discovery then another one will .\nIt is unfair to hold responsible the scientist on the fore front of human knowledge , who discovers something when another scientist in another part of the world may make the discovery independently afterwards .\nThe only argument for making scientists responsible for their work , is that quite often , and particularly in the case of genetic manipulation , it would need a scientist to misuse knowledge , and therefore they should be responsible .\nWhile genetic manipulation is relatively new , it takes a scientist to carry it out , and therefore an individual scientist could be held responsible .\nBut , once genetic manipulation becomes common - place in the future , and it is not only the domain of scientists , the originals scientist who discovered genetic manipulation can not be held responsible for other 's misuse of it .\nThere are many problems facing the Monarchy .", "Some of them are listed below :\nThe divisions in their family and the fight between prince and the princes of Wales and the possibility of the divorce .\nThe other problem is that people say ( or think ) that they do not do anything but they are rich and also they do not pay any taxes .\nAnother problem is that people think that Monarchy is abolishing in many countries and many countries are republic so Monarchy should be abolished in this country too .\nThere are also arguments against abolishing the Monarchy too .\nFor example many people like the royal family or they are honest people not like the politisions that always lay .\nI think the royal family and Monarchy is a a tradition in UK and anywhere in the world , UK is known by its royal family , so I do not think it should be abolished .\nIn the end I think if many people want the Monarchy to be ablished a general election should be called and then see if Monarchy should be abolished .\n\" In Vitro fertilisation \" is the fertilisation of an egg in the laboratory ie . in a testube .\nThe egg is taken from the mother and placed in an environment which will optimise the chances of fertilisation by the sperm from the father .\nOnce fertilisation has occured the fertilised egg is implanted back into the mothers womb and from there on the pregnancy will be normal .\nNormally more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is unsuccesful or so that more than one can be fertilised at the same time to increase the chance of a succesful pregnancy .\nThis usually leads to multiple births ie .\ntwins , triplets etc .\nThere are people who are agains this , saying it is not natural and is it fair to the child having started life in a test tube , as they believe life starts from the moment of conception .\nThere are ethics involved whereby who is given the treatment and who is n't ?\n, at what age should the treatment not be given and is it justifiable to spend so much money on in vitro fertilisation for one person when the same amount of money could be used to saves hundereds of lives by vaccinating people against measles for example .\nThe people who are for this can argue by saying that it is the right of every person to have their own child .\nWomen who would not normally be able to have children can now do so with invitro fertilisation .\nThrough no fault of her own she could have a blocked fallopian tube causing her to be unable to allow eggs down to the womb and it is only fair in helping her to have children .\nTechnology has progressed quickly and in doing so ethics and practical guidelines have been left behind .\nI therefore think it is necessary to have certain regulations ie .\n1 . Fertility treatment should not be given to post - menopausal women .\nThe menopause is the body 's way of telling you that you are to old and your body is no long capable of bearing a baby .\nLast year there was a case of a post menopausal woman who by lying about her age was given in vitro fertilisation ( IVF ) .\nI do n't think this is fair or morally correct to the child since her mother would be claiming her pension when she was at primary school and her mother would probably die while the child was in her teens .... there should be a test that is given before ( IVF ) is carried out to check the mother is not past the menopause .\n2 .", "Eggs should not be taken from aborted foetuses .\nThe foetuses will have been aborted for a reason for example : if it was the result of a rape or if it had congenital deformities .\nThere should be a guideline or law stating that eggs should only be taken from the mother and not from dead , foetuses .\nScience has moved on dramatically since the C19th .", "Many new things have been invented and many things medically have changed .\nPeople in our modern times are now able to have liver , heart and even lung transplants , there are many complications but many are succesful .\nPeople are able to have a whole new blood supply if theirs lacks the sufficient requirements or , a bone marrow transplant if the blood lacks white cells .\nAll the above are carried out on living people , but nowadays biological operations can be carried out on humans which are not even born .\nBodies can start their days in a test tubes .\nThis is called ' in vitro fertilisation ' .\nThis is when an egg is removed from a woman placed in a test tube and then sperm is placed in to the test tube and the egg and sperm fuse together .\nThe test tube is then incubated for a few weeks and when the fetous is formed , the baby is then inserted back in to the mother .\nThe fetous is left to grow and develop naturally .\nThis idea is extremely benificial to married couples who have been trying for a baby but have been unsuccesful are able to have children .\nAn in vitro fertilisation allows the baby to grow inside , which allows the mother and baby to bond and it would feel apart of her , this would not happen if the couple adopted .\nWhat I do feel is ethically incorrect is when a woman who is post - menopausal decides she wants a baby .\nNature has already taken its course to tell her she is too old to have any children so why should she have one implanted into her .\nIt is not fair on the child because when it grows up and all its friends are playing with their 30 - 40 year old parents , its mother could be drawing her pension and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child .\nAlso the mother may die of old age before the child has led a full life and this would be unfair to the child .\nThe child may also have to look after the mother in her old age .\nAs the fetous begins its life in a test tube , and the sperm is selected , this means that the sex of the sperm could also be selected .\nThe way the sex can be chosen is by using genetics .\nThe women has 2 X chromosomes and the man has one X and a Y - chromosomes .\nThe way in which the sex can be selected is that the egg is always X and the sperms nucleus can either contain an X or a Y chromosome .\nThe X chromosome sperm is slightly heavier than the Y so they can be separated .\nIf the mother wants a boy Y sperm is selected and if a girl X is selected .\nThis may lead to an increase in one sex , and a decline in the other .\nAs a result this would reduce the population as there would be less couples .\nAlso what happens if most people the year you are born are men and you are a woman , this would be the unpopular sex .\nScience is progressing all the time , but is it for the best ?\nThe main reason for the people of Britain to stop eating beef at the moment is the threat of BSB .\nThis is a viral disease that attacks the central nervous system which can be passed on through consumsuming the animal .\nIn cows it is commonly know as mad cow disease and by law any cow showing these signs must be destroyed and not sold for meat .\nThe problem is however the signs are not shown for a long time , this being a viral disease .\nIt can be passed on to humans through eating parts of the animal such as the brain which is affected and these parts are usually sold and put into fast foods such as beef burgers .\nThe rest of the meat however is relatively safe and eating , e.g. a steak offers very little chance of the disease being passed on .\nHowever the British press has ignored this fact and blown the situation out of proportion considering only a very small number of people have died of the disease after a lifetime of eating beef .\nAnother reason for the British people to stop eating beef is the push for vegetarianism , although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the former point abut BSB .\nThese factors could have a considerable impact on the agricultural industry preventing the sale of British dairy livestock not only in Britain but for export aswell .\nWith global communications as good as they are now , it could send a scare across the world about British Beef - indeed France and Germany already have restricted and someplaces banned the sale or import of British beef for fear of it 's safety .\nAlthough British farmers have learned to diversits , Dairy farming and the sale of Beef products still forms the backbone of British agriculture and would completely change the face of farming in Britain .\nWether they switch to sheep or vegetable crops were made , substantial changes would be needed to change the situation .\nPeople throughout the United Kingdom were , doubtless shocked and perhaps upset by images in the national press and television news of cows who had contracted the disease bovine spungiform encephalapthy , or BSE .\nThe so - called ' mad cow disease ' seemed to make the cows lose all sense of balance and direction , stumbling around drunkenly .\nHerds where this disease was found were put down before the symptoms progressed further .\nThose cows which had been put down were not used for food .\nThe disease infects the cow , and is then present in the spinal fluid within the spine and the brain , and as the spinal fluid is usually spilt in the slaughter of cattle for meat , the risk of contamination of the meat was one the industry was not willing to take .\nThe human disease , Crentzfeld - Jacob disease , or CJD , is believed to be a human form of BSE , although no clear link has yet been established between the two .\nIt is unclear whether incidence of CJD is on the rise , or whether awareness of the condition is heightened , but more cases , from all ages have been diagnosed recently , and the disease is always fatal .\nThe government insists , perhaps correctly , that British beef is perfectly safe to eat .\nHowever , people are genuinely scared of the presence of the disease in the U.K. , and many are abstaining from eating beef .\nMany schools have removed beef from their menus , substituting pork and chicken , and sales of beef have shown a decline .\nThe implications for the beef industry could be rather serious , where everybody to boycott beef products .\nTo compensate , beef prices have dropped , in attempts to sell more meat , but the public remains sceptical .\nIf beef continues to fall from favour , then the beef industry 's future would be unclear .\nBeef products are present in many foodstuffs such as jellies , fruit gums , and of course stock cubes .\nWould all these products have to find synthetic or substitute ingredients ?\nEven if the entire beef industry were to grind to a halt , the numerous heads of beef cattle worldwide would no longer be needed , but , being bred as they are , for beef , they would be useless for milk products .\nNot all beef can be infected , though , and the situation has become a waiting game .\nFor beef to be repreived or condemned , we are forced to turn to the scientists to establish whether or not BSE and CJD are linked , and , more importantly , whether the latter can be contracted by eating meat contaminated with the former .\nThe nation awaits the verdict on tenterhooks , and it is in the majority 's interests that there be no proven link .\nWatch this space .\nPersonally , I believe that it is merely that man is better at diagnosing CJD now than ever before .\nSome reports say that it can take up to 20 years to develop , so we could all already have it .\nWhatever you believe , I shall continue to enjoy my roast beef and Yorkshire pudding , thankyou .\nThere has been a big scare in Britain recently that some beef may contain BSE ( bovine spongiform encephalopathy ) which may lead to the human equivalent of CJD ( Creutzfeldts - Jacob disease ) .\nBSE is a disease in cows that effects their brain and spiral tissue ( or offal as it is sometimes known ) .\nAfter a few reported cases of CJD , a similar form of the disease found in humans , it is know thought that ' mad - cow disease ' ( BSE ) is the cause .\nResearchers believe that eating beef containing offal will transmit the fatal disease to humans .\nThis claim has devestated the British beef industry as people are now too scared to eat beef in case they contract the illness .\nAlready the sales of beef in America have dropped by about 15 % and in Britain they have dropped about 6 % - 7 % .\nAlthough scientists say that to contract CJD part of the cows offal must be contained within the beef .\ncustomers are still reluctant to eat the meat incase it has come from some ' dodgy ' butcher trying to cut costs .\nAs you can imagine this has had a tremendous inffluence on sales in places such as fast food restaurants where beefburgers are the main item on the menu .\nAn example of one is MacDonalds where they have immediately brought out a notice stating that their beefburgers are made from 100% of the finest , pure beef and contain no offal .\nIn my views no half decent restaurant with a good reputation would risk buying poor beef in case a customer caught CJD and they managed to trace it back to the restaurant .\nAn outcome like this would mean they would be sued for several thousands of pounds and would probably have to sell up .\nAs a result of a lower beef demand in places of food production there would be a lower need for beef cows .\nThis means that there would be an excess of beef ( or a beef mountain ) that could not be sold .\nBecause of this the prices of beef would have to decrease in order to attract more customers .\nSo , as a result of the claim that beef containing contaminated offal may cause CJD in humans , farmers ( in particular beef farmers ) are losing out as they will have to sell their meat for a lower price due to the low demand .\nAs a result they may have to diversify towards other areas such as crops , milking cows , etc . or even have to get a government subsidy .\nI feel that the evidence that BSE causes CJD was not strong enough before the claims were released .\nIt has therefore caused an unnecessary , deleterious effect on the agricultural industry and beef market .\nThe question of compensation for services rendered is never so simple as remitting a predetermined salary based on qualifications and a person 's dedication to the task at hand .\nIf one has preconceived notions concerning one 's salary , one will certainly be disappointed since some employers are sure to value their skills and abilities less than others . \"\nContribution to society \" is subjective and therefore impossible to compensate \" equally ' .\nIn the 1920s in American , it became very popular to disdain people who did not actually work for a living , but merely lived off the interest of their investments .\nThe stock market was experiencing a boom , and several formerly working - class citizens became wealthy and relished the idea of retiring early .\nBut several great authors of that period questioned the right of these investors to effectively live as parasites ; they received money , but they contributed nearly nothing to society .\nPeople who inherit money or live off the interest of investors often seem to spend their time in search of a new thrill , some sort of excitement that money can not buy .\nHaving almost unlimited wealth changes people , both those who are born into wealth and those who earn their own money early on .\nBut do they have the right to live this way ?\nWhat about people who work very hard yet they seem to be paid miserably .\nA migrant work may slave away in a field all day long and make less money in a day than a wealthy person spends on a tip at lunch .\nThe answer this question lies in one 's feelings about Democracry .\nSome would argue that if a person is smart enough or lucky enough to earn money for an early retirement ( or for their children 's inheritance ) he or she is entitled to it .\nA rather hard view would be that if someone who works on a menial or physically taxing job does not make a fair or moderate salary then it is his or her own fault ( or bad luck ) .\nThese opinions are based on a rather faulty American premise that all people are given an equal chance in life and what they make of it is their own responsibly .\nApparently , most people believe that they are underpaid and that others are overpaid .\nFor instance , everyone seems to think that doctors make much too money for the work they do , yet none of the doctors are lowering their fees ( they must think that it 's a fair price ) .\nSo , unless we wish to impose on the personal lives of wealthy people by making them work harder , or give people who are not wealthy money that society does not believe they deserve , we can not give pay equal to contribution to society .\nI agree that in the past women have had problems with societies role of what they are expected to do in the work place and at home .\nWomen have been looked down on if they try to get ahead and pay has differed with the same job for a man verses a woman doing the same job .\nGone is the age that the woman is required to stay home .\nNow a lot of women work and the ones that want to stay home do it because they want to .\nA lot of what has changed women 's roles is the feminists .\nThese are groups of people that have defended women over the years .\nThese people have shown the modern world what women in the work place can do .\nThe problem is that these feminists have not looked at all women .\nSome women were happy with old traditions , some wanted a bit more in their lives , some wanted a lot more in their lives .\nWhat happens is that all women have to go along with these feminists rules .\nThis makes it hard , because if they do n't , they are looked down upon by their piers .\nAn example is military women wanting to serve in combat positions when at war .\nFeminists argued this a lot when the Iraq war was going on .\nThey felt that women should have been given the chance to fight .\nI felt that these people were crazy .\nWomen just ca n't fight in a war very well .\nThe are not strong enough and if captured could be raped .\nThey feel that it is not fair that men are the only ones .\nOther women , though , are glad that the rule in the United States stands as it does .\nFeminists have talked about promotions in the work place as not being fair .\nAlso sexual harassment is involved in a lot of suits .\nMany women believe that they are the victims .\nI agree that five to ten years ago this might have been true , but now many employers are the victims .\nThey are scared of what a woman can do and sometimes women get looked at differently .\nThere are some things that women can do better than men and there are some things that men can do better than women .\nGod would have created us all the same if this was not true .\nFeminists are trying to make everyone equal and that is impossible to do because nature can not be changed .\nMore and more office jobs are being filled by the woman but a lot of the physical jobs are still filled by men .\nI think that the traditional roles were a good thing , but the modernization has changed everyone 's habits .\nDivorce is at fifty percent and rising , women are having more heart attacks , being more stressful , and kids are being more neglected .\nModernization is good , but I think that women should not be pressured into this if this is not for them .\nThere will be a woman in the presidency , and running a lot more companies .\nWomen should be created equal , but they can only do what nature intended they to do ...\nWhenever a movement is began whether it be political , religious , or artistic , stereotypes are quick to form .\nPeople normally associated with politics , religion , or art are quickly lumped into categories regardless of individual differences .\nThis tragedy is worsened by the tendency of those outside the movement to remember the radical and ignore the common or ordinary .\nThis is especially true of the Women 's Liberation Movement in America .\nSince its beginnings in the late nineteenth century , Women 's Liberation has been met with adamant , and often obstinate oppostion .\nSome of the first radicals , Susan B. Anthony and George Sand ( although French ) were noticed and ridiculed , thus defeating their cause , because of their aggressive action .\nAt the same time other feminists such as Emily Dickinson were virtually ignored during their lifetime and only acknowledged posthumously as being part of the movement .\nThis ignorance of other less aggressive feminists , made it seem as though the feminist movement was headed only by wild , disgruntled zealots and was therfore , detrimental to the good of society .\nAlthough \" radicals \" such as Sand and Anthony seem docile and backward in modern standards , the problem still exists .\nFrom the very beginning the Women 's Movement in America has been fighting a losing battle .\nHowever , I contend that the fault does not lie with the radical members of the movement , but rather , in the perception of those observing the movement .\nWhen Women 's Lib really took off again in the late 1960s , it was again destined for failure .\nImmediately , the focus was on radicals like Stein , instead of the housewife who returned to college and made a career for herself .\nThose outside the movement could only see the differences between \" normality \" and Women 's Lib .\nThis is still true twenty - five years later .\nWomen supporting equal pay for women and and other \" liberal \" causes like affirmative action are only seen in the shadow of the bra - burning , anti - shaving leaders of the 1970s .\nThe good of their cause is undermined by the perception of the radicals .\nSo what am I getting at ?\nOnly that so - called feminists have not in and of themselves harmed the Women 's movement .\nHowever , the popular perception of them has .\nFor so many years the good that feminists have promote for women has fallen by the wayside in lieu of other more interesting , i.e. radical ideas .\nLike many other aspects and movements in life , they would be more readiliy received if the public it was being aimed was not so jaded .", "Within this century there have been many technological advances which have resulted in a drastically different society than that of a hundred years ago .\nClearly , of the inventions of this century , the one that has made the most impact on world views and lifestyle is the television .\nThis instrument has brought other worlds right into the living room , making it possible to see life in other countries in a way that was never before possible .\nHowever , the invention of television also gave society an easy way to waste time ; one has only to turn it on to tune out reality .\nTelevision has potential to offer wonderful things to its viewers , such as educational programming for children , cultural programs about far away places , and a closer look at current events than can not be given by newspaper .\nTelevision has the power to bring war into the home as well as artistic expressions of those involved in the program production , giving society the opportunity to understand their own culture more fully .\nHowever , this is not the way in which television has influenced society .\nOn the contrary , television has become the escape route of the masses , a way for people to flee from the conflicts they experience in their culture , rather than confront them and try to understand them .\nIn the minds of most Americans , television is regarded as a diversion rather than an educational tool , as free entertainment instead of easily accessible knowledge .\nMillions of Americans can be found to be staring at the T.V. at any one time , watching sit - coms , soap - operas , and cartoons .\nThe T.V. has become the center of many households ; in many families , the only time that everyone is together is when they are watching television .\nT.V. is a major cause of lack of togetherness found in many American families , and has also resulted in an increase in laziness .\nThe more time one spends watching TV , the less motivated he becomes ; there is no need to seek worthwhile activities when it is much easier to sit on the couch , pick up the remote control , and stare at a box .\nTelevision , therefore , has changed society in ways that could hardly have been dreamed of 00 years ago .\nIt has given society another creative vein , a look at worlds which could be seen in no other way , and an opportunity to better educate itself .\nHowever , throughout the years , television has lost much of its integrety ; the programs offered are usually cheap entertainment rather than education .\nThe entertainment aspect of television has offered society an easy escape from its problems and dificulties .\nTherefore , since the invention of television , society has becomed more informed but too lazy to think about this new information , and has distanced itself from family life .\nA discovery that has significantly changed many peoples lives and their ways of thinking is the epidemic , known as AIDS .\nThough it has probably been around for awhile , it 's presence hasn't really been known untill fairly recently , and it 's consequences have been devistating .\nAIDS has definately had an impact on people in the United States and probably all over the world because it always leads to death and there is no cure .\nIt has caused a lot of prejudice and paranoia among people which has torn them apart .\nFor example , there is more of stigma attached to being a homosexual male , not only because of their sexual preference , but they probably have AIDS too .\nThis kind of ignorant thinking is breaking us apart .\nAlso , when Ryan White , a boy who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion was diagnosed , the people of his town and his school treated him like a complete outcast and would n't allow him to attend school .\nWith new discoveries of AIDS , paranoia is at an all time high .\nDoctors are discovering that some undetectable strands of AIDS do exist .\nThis has really scared people because they may have AIDS and not even know it .\nI feel this has really made people think about their actions .\nIn the early eighties \" casual sex \" in the United States was a widely accepted idea , now it is something people really take into consideration and rarely occurs .\nRelationships seemed to be valued more than one night stands .\nPeople are starting to realize that they really do have to be careful , and with more education on this disease , I 'm sure more changes will come about .\nThe twentieth century has seen more wars than any other previous bloc of time .\nThough advances in communication , transportation , and information sharing , the world as a body of people living in close proximity , has rapidly shrunk .\nIn the second of the world wars , the race was on to create the most devastating , most powerful , and most frightening weapon our people had ever known .\nIn my opinion , the discovery and harness of atom and its energy and the corresponding invention of nuclear weapons have been the most significant factors of change in our lifetime , if not , perhaps , in several lifetimes .\nAs missile technology and nuclear fusion capacities increased and improved , fear began to replace nationalism , and our small world erected barriers between its members .\nFrom my experience as an American , I can remember associating communism with nuclear threat , Soviet citizens with anti - Christ , and bomb shelters , secret cities for underground , and weapons orbiting our planet , with daily , normal life .\nPerhaps this increasingly common mentality is the worst effect of our nuclear , cold war age .\nIn a planet which desperately needs our focus on environmental and humanitarian issues , my country has spent uncountable trillions of dollars on nuclear weapons testing , improvement , and implementation .\nAs a commonplace goal and testimonial landmark to 9 presidential administrations , the cold war has manifested its awesome power and control over nearly every facet of Americana ; from survival kits and basement bombshelters to an ever circulating cheif Executive commandpost from the air .\nIn just the past three years our family of nations has seen the dismantling of the Berlin Wall and hundreds of other smaller symbols of freedom , and an end to oppression in many circumstances .\nWith this , the walls , barbed wire , and mental barriers are falling , bringing more change than our planet has seen since its genesis .\nAlthough the old habits die hard , they are indeed dying .\nIn America the military has been reduced by several thousand troops , and the production of nuclear warheads has virtually arrived a standstill .\nHopefully , with continued efforts , our use of nuclear fusion and fission will turn from mediums of strategy , destruction , and waste to matters of energy production , medicine , and other humanitarian goals .\nWith this thawing of attitudes , our frigid planet and cold neighbors may once again be a warm and friendly people .\nThe discovery of penicillin as an antibiotic was one of the greatest advances in medicinal chemistry .\nAs a natural antibiotic , penicillin was discovered to have many uses in stopping and preventing the spread of infections .\nThis \" wonder - drug \" also led to the discovery of a variety of other naturally - occurring antibiotics that could also be cultured \" in vitro \" in a laboratory .\nThis sudden burst of useful compounds not only improved the chances of a patient 's survival in a hospital but also caused a great need for medical chemists to study and classify each new drug as it was discovered .\nAs discoveries of new antibiotics decreased , chemists began to wonder if certain variations of these drugs could be synthesized and also used as medicine .\nIt was also attemped to increase the production of the naturally - occurring antibiotics through synthesis .\nBoth of these new attempts caused a need for more research , more companies , and more medical chemists , and the industry increased tremendously .\nIt was discovered that the older drugs could be synthesized efficiently while still remaining biologically active .\nNew drugs were also synthesized ; some were found to be medically useful while others were not .\nA variety of new drugs continuously appeared on the market and changed the way people thought about taking medicine .\nIt was now much easier to obtain antibiotics for simple illnesses , such as the common cold .\nHuge enterprises , such as Upjohn , were formed and grew , and universities had research teams devoted to producing efficient synthesis routes for the production of all kinds of antibiotics .\nThe discovery of one compound led to the increase of health of millions of people , to the discovery of more and more antibiotics , and to a booming industry comprised of research teams and large companies .\nThe synthesis of antibiotics and research of their uses still continues today as thousands of universities and companies around the world continue the work of a small bacteria -- the producer of penicillin .\nThe modern microcomputer ( PC ) has evolved at an incredibly fast pace : from the very first modern computer in the 1940 's to the computers of today , there have been many technological advances and also there has been a tremendous impact on society .\nThe computer has eliminated many jobs through automation of factories ; accounting , engineering , and other scientific programs , etc .\nThe effects of the computer have been tremendous ; however , the phenomenon is a catch-22 .\nThe computer has made life easier from a physical standpoint and harder from a mental standpoint .\nThe physical effects of the computer are numerous and easily seen .\nIn offices , the computer is everywhere .\nFrom word processors to spreadsheet / database programs , computers have made office work easier and faster .\nAutomation of factories has also eliminated many manual jobs .\nAlso almost everyone has at least one simple computer , e.g. a calculator .\nThere are of course many other things computers are used for , but a lengthy list is not necessary as everyone already knows ( except for people in 2nd and 3rd world countries ) how abundant computers are .\nThe mental effect of computers is two - fold .\nFirstly , computers have made mathematical computations so easy to do , many people do not fully understand how or why their computer works .\nThis has created a surplus of \" needless \" computations , figures , etc .\nPeople can easily do calculus or other type functions with a computer .\nWhat many people do not realize is that computers make errors all the time .\nGranted , it is the person who \" told \" the computer what to do that truly made the error ; however if that person knew what he should do , or better stated \" was able to do with a computer \" , he would not have erroneous answers .\nMathematical models , theories , etc .\nare absolutely riddled with errors simply because there are many things people do n't know or ca n't predict .\nDue to this errors frequently exist in the world of computers simply because humans are ignorant- for whatever reason - of many \" variables \" .\nSecondly , computers have sometimes become more reliable than people .\nA computer 's circuits do n't get tired and , if programmed 100% correctly ( another perhaps impossible computation ) , never make errors .\nThis supposed reliability has left many workers out of work .\nThe effects of this are unpredictable .\nAnger , frustration , fear , and many other negative feelings have sprung up simultaneously with the rise of computer usage .\nClearly , there is evidence of good and bad results from the advent of the modern computer .\nIt would be practically impossible to throw the computer away or never use it again .\nYet there are practical solutions .\nBetter mathematical education is needed for everyone who uses a computer other than a simple calculator .\nAlso , curtailing some theoretical programming could eliminate alarming predictions or erroneous results .\nThe key is probably in the classroom .\nPeople should learn more about the ramifications about what they are doing .\n( This probably would require understanding of philosophy and psychology as well as mathematics and science . )\nIn either case , if computers are good or bad , it would be difficult to dispute their impact on people 's lives .\nA large , 1/2 egg , sometimes as large as a small FIAT , with a metal arrow in it 's center has changed the size of the world , and communication amongst the countries within it .\nThe satellite dish , created in the last 0 years , has changed the meaning of telecommunication .\nIn part , it has created The Information Age , as the latter part of the 20th ctry , is often labelled .\nNot certain about the date of its invention , it must be recognized as one of the more vital tools used in society today , amongst world leaders , trading companies , and the media , as well as the entertainment world .\nTed Turner revolutionized the use of the satellite , with his creation of CNN , the round - the - clock , round - the - world news station .\nPresidents and dictators alike switch the channel to recieve first hand information from the network , such as impeachments , coup d'etats or civil wars .\nDecisions , of governmental autonomy , are being made , based on that nights news CNN commentator .\nThe leaders and presidents of enterprises such as panasonic and CORE refer to CNN , created by satellite dish , on a daily bases .\nStocks are an integral part of their livelihood .\nThe entertainment world has taken full advantage of the satellite dish , subtitling the Information Age , with the MTV age .\nThe creation of MTV in 1980 , has dramatically changed the entertainment business .\nThe money poured into creating videos , and the profits from viewership- have had a strong affect on the world economy .\n40% of U.S. millionares are entertainers .\nThe Satellite dish has also created distinct advantages for Cable TV and naval programs as well .\nThe intelligence of an average teenager is lowering itself due to cable viewing , created by the satellite dish .\nNaval programs have wasted exceeding amounts of money in the United States , due to the satellite dish .\nAnd one must not forget space programs such a STARWARS .\nThe creation of the satellite dish in the past 20 years , has altered the average intelligence of the human being for the better and sometimes worse .\nIt has created an information age , which could be dangerous , and heightened an entertainer 's salary .\nThe pro 's and con 's of the satellite dish are numerous .\nThe only observation which can be made , is that : It has altered people lives significantly .", "It is up to the average person to decide if this alteration will be for the better or worse .\nThe discovery of the Atomic energy , is undoubtedly the the most awesome as well as terrible invention not only of the 20th century but of all time .\nIn 1945 , J. Robert Oppenheimer unveiled to the world his invention in the form that is still most familiar to us today : The Atomic bomb .\nThe reason behind the fear that this energy causes is routed in its incredible power to destroy .\nNever before had the world seen something with such a capacity to kill .\nNever before had one object of such small size been able to take so many lives .\nFor this reason , It is considered the most awe - inspiring and dangerous weapon in the world .\nUnfortunately , with each progressive day , the world 's need for this dangerous energy augments .\nFor not only does it have the capacity to kill ,\nbut also the capability to supply and energize the world .\nThe drawback is the danger .\nIn utilizing this power in plants and factories we run the risk of contaminating our land , blowing holes in our sky , rendering our seas useless , and killing our species as well as all the species of the earth .\nAlthough we have many other power source alternatives , we still continue to use this dangerous invention .\nIt is illogical to think that with continued nuclear use , we can escape harm .\nAlready as a result of pollution and other various factors , we have holes in our ozone layer and problems with our soil in many parts of the world .\nIt would be logical to think that the leaders of the world would confer and aspire to put a stop to nuclear use in an effort to avoid any further damage to the earth and its inhabitants .\nThe saddest part of this tragedy is that there have been very few efforts to do so .\nThe lack of sight from our leaders is almost appalling .\nWith the lack of respect for the planet that is the general attitude of today , what is to become of our children .\nThe current situation of the world 's environment is a sad one .\nIt is also however , a problem of which nuclear energy is only a small piece .\nUnfortunately , the day will soon come when the damage caused by this apathy will be irreversable .\nThis is why it is imperative to act today .\nIt starts with you .\nWrite your local congressman .\nAn invention of the 20th century which I think has significantly changed people 's lives is the invention of the airplane .\nThe extend to which this invention has altered people 's lives is astronomical .\nThe airplane opened doors to traveling and also broadened people 's perceptions of the entire world .\nIt also introduced what seemed a completely impossible concept which no human is capable of doing without a machine : the concept of flying .\nBefore the invention of the airplane , long distance traveling was a very difficult , time consuming task .\nFor this reason people did not travel extremely long distances and missed the opportunity of visiting countries with cultures very different from their own .\nOne could travel by boat but this was inconvenient and often dangerous because of various things like disease , hunger , and threatening weather ; also as noted above , it was extremely time consuming .\nBecause of the lack of long distance travel people often had a very ethnocentric and limited concept of the world .\nI have learned a lot about my own culture just from being in Spain and that is the only foreign country I have ever visited .\nI can admit that before I came to Spain I was very ignorant about other cultures .\nEven though I would watch the news and read about other cultures I still did not have the opportunity to witness it first hand .\nThe invention of the airplane has opened many doors and one other door is international relations .\nSince the invention of the airplane the world has increased close contact between political systems , and international business endeavors .\nThe frequency that which foreign countries are able to communicate and negotiate face to face has improved drastically the establishment of international trade .\nThe airplane has also basically speeded up the whole postal communication system also .\nLife with airplanes is more rapid paced .\nCars , telephones , and nuclear energy are just three examples of inventions and discoveries that have had profound effects on modern day life .\nWe must remember , however , that the field of technology is not the only one in which significant advances have been made in the 0th century .\nAnother \" discovery \" of this past century has been feminism , which has had a significant impact on the lives of both men and women .\nOf course , the issue of feminism is not a new one , but it is just within the past century that much progress has been made towards the equality of women ( with the important exception of women winning the right to vote in the 1800s ) .\nAs recently as the 1950s , it was still the most typical as well as the ideal to have the woman in the home , housekeeping and tending the children .\nThe first significant equal rights movement in the U.S. was in the 70s with the Equal Rights Amendment , which failed .\nEven today , the woman is still only earning something like 60 cents for every dollar that a man earns .\nFeminism does not only have to do with work and money , but also with the image of women .\nIt 's only recently that we 've \" discovered \" , or begun to think about rather , how much things as varying as pornography or the language we use helps to form the image of women .\nA recognition of such influences on the image of women is the first step in breaking it down , so that women are seen for who they truly are .\nFeminism is better described as a \" discovery in progress \" ; it 's a movement , an attitude that has not yet become mainstream .\nOnly when women have achieved equality with men , will there cease to be a need for feminism , and the discovery will have been completed .\nThe idea I feel that has most significantly changed people 's lives in the 20th century is that of caring for the environment .\nToday , people have become aware of the importance of environment to our future .\nPeople are concerned with nuclear weapons .\nWe realize that countries that which have many weapons have the power to destroy the world .\nAlso related to this topic is nuclear waste .\nNuclear waste is not only harmful to humans ; it also kills animals and plants .\nWe are now fighting for acts to clean up our lakes and rivers .\nCompanies are no longer able to freely dump their wastes w / o being heavily fined .\nPeople have also become concerned with nature .\nWe used to assume our natural resources were never ending .\nNow , though , we realize what we use , needs to be replaced .\nFor example deforestation is a very big issue , many groups have formed to plant more trees .\nWe also realize our fossil fuels need to be used more conservatively .\nAnother important topic we are all aware of is recycling .\nThis links 2 issues , one of not producing much nonbiodegradable products and the other of reusing what we have .\n( Recycling in a small way also helps those w / o homes b / c they receive money for their collections ) .\nMany countries realize that recycling is not only beneficial to their economy it also is beneficial to their environment .\nAnother important issue is that of conserving energy .\nIn the past , once again , we assumed our energy was never ending .\nNow though people are more inclined to turn off their lights when they 're not in their rooms , to not leave taps running and basically not to waste our natural resources .\nWe realize that conserving is not beneficial to our environment but it is also saves money .\nWe have also become more considerable of our animal life .\nWe are no longer able to kill animals freely .\nWe do still raise some for food but hunting is limited and we are all aware of the possibilities of extinction .\nOne realizes that animals have rights too .\nIn conclusion , the idea of caring for the environment is still a new one .\nWe are slowly becoming more aware and are beginning to take more precautions .\nThe ideas above are just a few of the topics we are now concerned with .\nBut we are heading in the right direction and hopeful by the 21st century we will have fixed everything we have destroyed !\nComputers have definitely effected peoples lives .\nI have a computer and my life has change because of it .\nI 'm able to store almost all the information I need for school and for other things in my computer whereas before I had a computer my desk was cluttered w/ paper and records of all sorts , I no longer need to keep these records but only to transfer them to my computer .\nThis means I 'm able to store more information in an organized fashion .\nThough I have only used a fraction of my computer 's ability , I 'm still aware of the tremendous opportunities which I have or will have .\nAside from being able to store great amounts of info , I 'm also able to process and to edit things quickly .\nFor example , without the use of a computer I had to balance my checkbook once a month and had to this w/ a calculator , a pen and a piece of paper .\nOf course , this was very time consuming and open to error . W/ the use of a computer I have programmed the computer to make the calculations which I once had to make .\nAlso , w/ the use of the Word Processor I 'm able to edit and rearrange documents w / out altering the entire document , and furthermore , though I have yet to use the Communications program in my computer , this program seems to be extraordinarily helpful .\nMy father has the same program in his computer and is able to buy on line tickets w / out leaving the house and moreover w / out picking up the phone .\nAlso , I realize that my experience w/ computers is limited and that the power of computers , for me , is incomprehensible .\nI 'm now here in Madrid .\nHow did I get there ?\nWell , I applied to the this program , was accepted , and flew here form the US .\nBut , w / out the use of computers I would still be struggling w/ the secretary in the International Programs Office at Boston University , no doubt .\nInstead , once I applied to the program- the application for which was probably computer generated- I assume my info was processed by a computer .\nW / out this luxury , the International Programs Office would inevitably inundated w/ paperwork and things would therefore be lost or at least misplaced .\nWhen booking my flight , though I did not do this myself , the transaction would seem impossible minus the aid of computers .\nComputers have had a most significant impact on the people in the latter 1/2 of the 20th century .\nAn invention of the 20th century that I think has significantly changed people 's lives is television .\nTV allows the instantaneous communication of ideas , images , news , etc .\nNow , if something is happening in any part of the world- from across town all the way to Beijing -- every person in the world can watch this event as it is happening .\nWhile previously people had to wait days , or even weeks for news ( which consisted of second - or third - hand accounts , which always involved much interpretation and distortion ) now they can see it happening , for themselves , as it is happening , this allows them to make their own , informed judgment about the event ; and if a reaction is necessary- such as the gathering of opposition to a certain law -- it can be made immediately , while the emotions are still strong , and before the action is finalized .\nAs well , the fact that so many people ( especially in the US ) have television sets means that everybody ( well , at least everybody who watches ) receives the same inflow of information and ideas .\nSo , for example , people in Spain can be informed about how people in California or Japan speak and act , this allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ideas .\nIn my opinion , this is one part of the process of making the world a \" smaller \" , more unified place , or a \" global village \" as one journalist has called this world of the Information Age .\nNot only the news , but also entertainment is an important practical function of television , through television entertainment , as through literature and drama , people learn different messages about life .\nThey can see various actions acted out to their ends , and understand the consequences of these actions , without having to perform the same actions and experience the consequences for themselves .\nUnfortunately these TV shows are not always accurate portrayals of real life and have a tendency to glorify violence , as well as making life seem the good guy always wins , and always lives thru dangerous situations .\nHowever , this sense of reality is not so distorted , and so hidden that people are going around acting like Superman .\nAs long as one has a well - developed sense of reality , TV can be an excellent tool for understanding the world we live in .\nThe waters of the culunary seas have been calm and consistant for centuries .\nProgress has move slow like the tides and the constant rythm of the waves have showed little changed .\nHowever with the daybreak of the twentyth century a storm has brewed .\nWith this storm the waters have churned and spawned a wave that has crashed upon the rocks of every kitchen .\nThis wave is the microwave .\nNever before has such an invention revolutionized a science like this .\nA complete break has been forged in the way food is prepared .\nAt the dawn of time , cave men cooked animal flesh over open fires .\nAs History progressed , spits and barbeques emerged .\nTechnology saw the advent of the wood stove , and later ones fueled by coal .\nModern times saw gas and electric ranges as to staple .\nAll these things had one thing in common : FIRE .\nFlame , the source of life , always used to prepare the fool of mankind throughout History .\nHowever , the microwave uses radiation to excite water particles in food , thus creating friction , which creates heat .\nThis is a prime example of thinking that does not follow in old footsteps but breaks away from convention and forges new routes .\nIf this were not amazing enough , the microwave cuts cooking time in half .\nIf you had told someone 100 yrs ago that you could cut cooking time in half , and not use fire , they would have thought you crazy , or bewitched , or under the influence of heavy drugs .\nIn an age where time is the scarcest comodity , our society has embraced this eliminator of wasted hours in the kitchen .\nA mother who works , can come home can whip up something in minutes in the microwave , whereas before she would have been slaving in the kitchen .\nThe microwave is excellent for re - heating making it easier for people to make excess food to be eaten later .\nAgain time is conserved -- Children are able to use this simple device without parental fear of fires starting .\nFor As I have said before , there is no fire !\nThis marvel of technology has helped propel people into the dizzing pace of life that most of us lead in the 20th century .\nThroughout History one can see that great revelations in all areas come from breaks in tradition , new insights , and differents perspectives .\nAll these were needed to create the microwave which is essential nowadays .\nEating is something everyone must do .\nThis device has sped up one of our most important activities and thus revolutionized life in the fast paced 20th century .\nWhen I was in tenth grade a teacher said that the 2 most important inventions that made possible the idea of a repressive government were the machine gun and the radio .\nA machine gun can be used to keep civil peace , enforce Marshall Law .\nThe radio can be used to communicate ideas and under a dictatorship , propaganda .\nIn the 20th Century the machine gun has not changed all that many lives ( except for those that it ' s killed ) , but the invention of radio has made a tremendous impact .\nThe idea behind the radio is simple .\nThere is one transmitter and it sends its signals through the air , waves , with potential for millions of receivers .\nIn the 20th Century radio has become a source of information and entertainment .\nRadio keeps people informed .\nI don ' t think any people of my generation can even comprehend now our lives would be different .\nEvery morning I listen for the weather forcast and dress accordingly .\nAt night one can sit by the radio and hear how the events of the day unfolded .\nRadio , hence , gives people the option of becoming passive observers rather than active participants in the news making process .\nNewspapers had been around for many years but it was not until the invention of radio that the power of the media became evident .\nRadio gives the ability to reach many more people , instantly .\nAs a form of entertainment , radio and its most important and now more common offshoot , television , has changed people 's lives .\nA typical day for a child in today 's world , consists of going to school and coming home to watch T.V.\nThere have even been forms of entertainment , for example videogames , made for this other form of entertainment .", "Nowadays everybody watches T.V.\nMy se\u00f1ora , for example , is over 100 years old , and for her T.V. is the greatest thing in the world .\nShe sits in front of it all day and it keeps her happy .\nTelevision offers soap operas , game shows , sit - coms , sporting events , movies and much more to keep us entertained 24 hours a day .\nIn short , I don ' t know what life was like before radio , but its invention has changed the way we see and do things .\nA current ideology in the United States today is for one to be successful , one must follow all of the written and unwritten rules of society ,\neveryone has an equal opportunity to succeed and when one does not do this one fails .\nOne can see these ideas in popular media everyday .\nT.V. comercials and T.V. programs project models of how one should be .\nIn the 20th cen , the values of / that the United States was founded on have changed in meaning and sense when applied to modern day America , nothing was ever equal .\nAnd today , since the invention and utilization of modern technologies such as computers life for americans moves at a much faster pace .\nPeople are more mobile , can work more , and buy more things , but time for relaxation and family are often substitued with T.V. In America , this growing individualistic society , one nolonger sees the realitive humanness between people , instead one sees the differences , the unlucky , the unsuccessfull , and attribute thier inadequacy to achieve to a lack of effort .\nWith everyone moving at such a fast pace , the gaps are easy to miss , the voices of the mass media easily replace those voices that struggle to be heard .", "The parts of the new machine that need oiled and regulated .\nWhen Voltaire wrote Candide , a literary style known as Neoclassicism was at its peak .\nThere was a group of scholars in France , l'Academie Fran\u00e7ais , that set guidelines for French literature .\nAccording to l'Academie Fran\u00e7ais , all literature of the Neoclassic period must follow the rules of propriety which regulated the author should avoid certain topics , including sex , violence , church , and state issues .\nAnother standard upheld by the Academie is the idea of verisimilitude , making literature as realistic as possible by keeping the time , setting and plot true to life .\nVoltaire , as a Neoclassicist , knew all these regulations and followed them in his literature .\nHowever , when writing Candide , Voltaire defied the Academie 's rules .\nCandide is a parody on the guidelines of Neoclassicism .\nNeoclassicists liked for literature to have good manners : they did not want to step on anyone 's toes by mentioning sex , violence , church , or state issues .\nIn Candide Voltaire did not seem to mind stepping on toes - in fact , he did not mind smashing feet !\nVoltaire went beyond the comfort level when he mentioned sex .\nHe told of the two girls of Orellion who were lovers of monkeys , and of the Baron who bathed with the Musselman and was punished for his homosexual act .\nSex turned into violence when Cunegonde was being raped by a Barber , and witnessed his murder while he was on top of her .\nThe wise old woman underwent the removal of a buttock by pirates , as well as experiencing rape .\nAfter the Baron is caught bathing with the Mussalman , he receives 100 lashes for his sin .\nCandide stabs the Baron , a Jesuit Priest , after the Baron forbids Candides marriage to Cunegonde .\nIronically , although Voltaire mentions many acts of violence , each act is treated lightly : Cunegonde and the old woman both tell their tales of being defiled like an entertaining story in their conversations about their travels ; the Baron also continues his tale with style after telling of his beating ; and after Candide \" kills \" the Baron , he leaves to search for Cunegonde with no second thought until he reencounters the Baron later in his travels .\nThe light attitude in which these acts of sex and violence are written shows the parody form in which Voltaire writes Candide .\nVoltaire chooses not to stay away from the church and state issues .\nHe attracts the hippocracy of the Church in the old woman 's father being the Pope .\nWhen Candide visits the land of Eldorado , Voltaire shows the people 's perfect relationship to God : they only praise God because there is nothing they want from God .\nVoltaire uses this perfect relationship to God in an unrealistic situation to foil society 's imperfect relationship with God in the real world .\nVoltaire makes fun of aristocracy in his description of the Baron , who came from 71 generations of nobility but still lacks gentilesse .\nCandide and his companions dine with 6 dethroned kings who represent the overimportance society places on hierarchy .\nIn his portrayal of the utopian society of Eldorado , Voltaire toils the imperfections of our society .\nAccording the Lunde , 35% of homicide victims are killed by someone they know .", "Statistics from 56 are greater than Lundes ' thesis .\nFrustration is the main factor most implicated in these tragedies .\nMost cases are those of the \" trigger puling the finger \" .\nToday , racial prejudice still exists , but less action has taken place than 30 years ago .\nThirty years ago , minorities could n't ride a bus , vote , or go to school with white people .\nDesegragation reduced some prejudice , but it still exists .\nThe difference is , today social prejudice is not openly expressed as it was 30 years ago .\nI would tell the client to be extremely nice to that person and do favors for that person .\nThat person would then feel obligated to do nice things back and return favors .\nThis is based on eauity theory .\nIt would be better for the client to do nice things for the person that it would be to ask a favor of the person .\nSomeone who live in the north who comes to live in the south may not be prejudice toward Blacks at first .\nAfter living in the south for a while , they may adopt southern attitudes toward Blacks and feel prejudice toward them .\nThis is conformity .\nThe same goes for Southerners who move north .\nThey come to feel prejudice toward Jews .\nI know someone who has lived all over the world .\nHe is prejudice toward Jews , Blacks , and Mexicans .\nHe adopted white attitudes against minorities in the different regions he has lived in .\nOur country has been coined a \" melting - pot \" inferring that we all come from different that we all come from different background but have joined or melted together to produce homogeneous Americans .\nBut a persons heritage , as we are realizing , is important to their sense of self and community .\nEthnic American cultures have been reviving and trying to reestablish roots that were once lopped off to a model U.S. citizen .\nThe differences they are rediscovering only add more color , flavor and excitement to that brewing \" pot \" of our people .\nHowever , some individuals and even groups of Americans are reacting negatively to this ethnic explosion ( seen most clearly through the arts ) .\nThey do n't want to accept these differences .\nThey choose to remain indifferent to the plights of their fellow Americans .\nAs Ellie Weisel , author of such books as Night says about indifference : it is the opposite of everything good .\nThe opposite of love , beauty , intelligence , light , joy , life and growth are not their familiar ontonyms but indifference .\nEthnic American literature tries to fight this indifference by vividly and uniquely expressing certain aspects of different American culture .\nThe gamut of ethnic American literature is without bounds .\nEach group has its own peculiarities and attributes that make it 's writing unique .\nIn many cases the words used in ethnic American literature reflect a knowledge of a different \" mother tongue \" .\nFor instance , Native Americans poetry is more expressive and visual partly because their language is deeply rooted in the observation of the natural environment .\nChinese American Literature is philisophical / literal because their native language is so .\nAfrican American literature is often melodious and rhythmic mirroring their similar achievements in Jazzy and Blues music .\nAll these examples ( and more ) give us some insight to other cultures we would otherwise never know .\nThe stories told in this genre of literature , however , are likely the most important aspect of Ethnic American literature .\nIt is through the experiences of the characters that we learn about the different cultures in the United States .\nWhen we learn of the trials and hardships that they went through we can sympethize with their emotions and try to accept that diversity .\nThe stories of black American slaves and of concentration camp victems are necessary to avoid indifference .\nWithout learning about the past ( and present ) horrors there is no way to ensure future humanity .\nEthnic American literature benefits U.S. citizens in many ways .\nIt opens our eyes to the reality of the suffering of others .", "It gives us a fresh and new perspective on the world around us .\nIt helps us to understand our personal relationships better .\nMost of all , it gives us more common ground on which to live , and grow , and prosper .\nHopefully we will someday fulfill Elie Weisel 's goal and end indifference ; this literature is a step in the right direction towards acceptance in the diversity of our country .\nDifferent is beautiful !", "Violence on television can be seen throughout the many channels that cable has to offer .\nWith an average national TV viewing time of 7 1/4 hours daily , the prevalence of violence in broadcasts is a serious concern .\nTelevision programming in the United States is considered the most violent in advanced industrialized nations ( Hepburn 1 ) .\nMany children watch violent tv shows because the action thrills them and can sometimes cause the child to become violent .\nViolence is common in TV entertainment-- the dramas that portray stories about crime , psychotic murderers , police cases , emergency services , international terrorism , and war ( Hepburn 1 ) .\nTelevision violence is prevalent in the United States and some people disagree with its effects on children .\nThe V - chip is an electrical device that blocks out violent television shows .\nSome people , such as the Senate Commerce Committee , are not satisfied with it .\nThe Senate Commerce Committee approved bills creating a partial ban on TV violence and a so - called report card that would identify stations carrying violent programming and the advertisers sponsoring it .\nThe bills would apply to broadcasting and cable ( Stern 1 ) .\nSome of the proposals to antiviolence are as follows : the Senate V - chip , the House V - chip , a Technology Fund , a Violence Safe Harbor , and a Violence Report Card .\nThese proposals could work if Congress had some support .\nThe National Association of Broadcasters accused the Senate of \" piling on a stream of proposals to build up an unprecedented federal censorship bureaucracy \" .\nThe NAB also insisted that broadcasters already have responded to concerns over violence on television ( Stern 1 ) .\nSome television shows show violence because it appeals to adult viewers .\nIf a certain plot involves a murder , then the murder must happen .\nSome people may not want the actual murder to be shown , but that is up to whomever is writing the television show .\nMany made for television movies say that it may contain violent scenes and that viewer discretion is advised , but how many parents actually watch television with their teenager ?\nAn exhaustive examination of the broadcast networks ' programming during the 1995 - 1995 season has concluded that sinister combat violence ' pervades a significant number of Saturday - morning cartoons ( Jensen 1 ) .\nHow much violence is there ?\nThe most violent cartoons are ' Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles ' , ' Spider Man ' , and some ' Bugs Bunny ' episodes with Elmer Fudd .\nAs for the shows containing sinister combat violence , well that is strictly up to the viewer to decide .\nThe cause for television violence is to add texture to the show and not to poison children 's minds .\nThe infamous V - chip may stop some shows from being shown to children , but one day that child will see violence and they will have to deal with it , rationally or not .\n"]
